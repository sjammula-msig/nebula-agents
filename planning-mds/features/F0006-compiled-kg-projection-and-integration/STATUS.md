## Phase-A Exit (merge-train) Progress

- [x] `merge3.py` replays the PR #47 resolution: re-serialization hunks converge to zero conflicts (2026-07-05: canonical-nodes 9,656 changed lines → 0 conflicts, 528→548 records; code-index clean with both sides' additions)
- [x] Known PR #47 real deltas surface as typed items — replay outcome per delta: `excluded_features` regression (PR re-adds stale F0038 exclusion) → `UniqueViolation` routed to product-manager+architect; F0038 archive repoint → converged one-sidedly to the archived path, no typed item needed; stale F0038 `status` (`architecture-complete` on an archived feature) → identical on both sides so correctly not a merge conflict — flagged as a PM data fix before the integrator run
- [x] Integrator dry-run on PR #47 emits a complete integration evidence run (`integrate-20260705-195057`, mode=dry-run, simulated gate-1 waiver labeled; outcome halted-conflicts with the F0038-exclusion UniqueViolation routed to PM+architect; poisoned-clean-merge proof on code-index captured)
- [x] Per-PR gate 1: maintainer decision 2026-07-05 — feature-review WAIVED for all train PRs, recorded per run (#47, #51, batch #50/#48/#49, batch #53/#54 — all ✓)
- [x] Per-PR gate 2: maintainer human test validation recorded per prepared merge (#47 PASS 2026-07-05; #51 and batches #50/#48/#49 and #53/#54 all PASS 2026-07-06)
- [x] PR #47 merged via integrator (runs integrate-20260705-195057 dry → 203038 live; F0038-exclusion fixup 500ab17; gate-2 pass; landed c6ccaa0 on local chore/merge-PRs)
- [x] PR #51 merged via integrator (stacked on #47 — delta replay): attempt integrate-20260705-205309 halted with 22 DivergentInserts (stale pre-archive F0038/Neuron records) → fixup 6f7c7ff → re-run integrate-20260705-235757 clean; gate-2 PASS 2026-07-06 (incl. Neuron env fix note); landed 4ce85fe
- [x] PRs #50 / #48 / #49 merged via integrator (batch on integrate/batch-50-48-49; runs integrate-20260706-012415 / -012853 / -013307; all semantic merges clean — 2 ROADMAP prose unions + code grafts recorded per run; batch gate-2 PASS 2026-07-06 incl. authentik blueprint fix; landed 5b3d154)
- [x] PRs #53 / #54 merged via integrator (batch on integrate/batch-53-54; runs integrate-20260706-030136 / -045307; **first real cross-feature semantic collision caught**: F0021 and F0008 both allocated ADR-029 → DivergentInsert on adr:029 routed to architect → F0008's ADR renumbered to ADR-031 across file + 24 doc refs + 10 KG refs; all merges then clean; batch gate-2 PASS 2026-07-06; landed 3cff188)
- [x] Integration branch (`chore/merge-PRs`) green after each merge (`validate.py`, orphan check, story-index zero-diff — recorded per run)
- [x] Promotion merge `chore/merge-PRs` → `main` after the train completes — the only change that touches `main` (2026-07-06, `e2f78be`; all 7 contributor PRs auto-flipped to MERGED on GitHub; **Phase-A merge-train exit COMPLETE**)

## Reference-Implementation Progress (product repo `scripts/kg/`)

- [x] Canonical serializer in `kg_common.py` (+ one-time no-semantic-change canonicalization commit, ID-level-diff verified via `merge3.py --semantic-diff`: 0 semantic differences per file)
- [x] `merge3.py`: record merge, field rules, taxonomy, all-or-nothing output, conflict report (text + JSON; `--semantic-diff` mode; generated-input guard; exit codes 0/1/2)
- [x] Tracker-row merge for REGISTRY/ROADMAP feature tables (`tracker_merge.py` via the `merge3.py` CLI; per-table order config incl. manual/operator order with both-added weave; counter max-merge; exclusive-section check; STORY-INDEX rejected; 18 tests; PR #47 replay clean with F0038 above F0021 per the published rule)
- [ ] `compile.py` deterministic (double-compile byte-identical; no committed timestamps)
- [ ] Logical-ref resolver wired into `validate.py` / `lookup.py` / `eval.py` call sites
- [ ] `decompile.py` with `--check`; round-trip `compile(decompile(graph))` byte-identical
- [ ] `kg-source/**` populated; `solution-ontology.yaml` rehomed under `kg-source/ontology/`
- [ ] Tracker generator owns fenced REGISTRY/ROADMAP table regions
- [ ] `validate.py --check-reproducible` + new rules (physical-path ban, alias ledger, glob overlap, archived⇒no-stale-path)
- [ ] `.gitattributes` (linguist-generated + merge driver) and CI workflow (warn → blocking)

## Framework-Contract Progress (`nebula-agents`)

- [x] `agents/integrator/SKILL.md` persona (duties, hard boundary, routing) — 2026-07-05
- [~] `agents/agent-map.yaml`: integrator registered (balanced tier) + `integrate` action wired with `review-verdict`/`approval` gates; Phase-B shard write scopes remain (S0004+)
- [x] `agents/actions/integrate.md` (incl. feature-review precondition + human test-validation pause, gates I0–I6, branch strategy) + `actions/README.md` + `ROUTER.md` routing
- [x] Integration evidence template + `integrate-operator-friendly.md` prompt (evidence home decided: base-run profile at `operations/evidence/runs/integrate-*`)
- [ ] `agents/actions/feature.md` G7/G8 reconciled (no off-book repoint narrative)
- [ ] `feature-operator-friendly.md` prompt reconciled
- [ ] `agents/docs/KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md` / `ORCHESTRATION-CONTRACT.md` / `MANUAL-ORCHESTRATION-RUNBOOK.md` updated
- [ ] Templates updated: `kg-reconciliation`, `feature-assembly-plan`, `tracker-governance`, `feature-registry`, `ci-gates`
- [ ] 2026-07-05 KG-regeneration enforcement surfaces reconciled for Phase B: `build.md`, `plan.md`, feature/build/plan prompt variants; `validate-feature-evidence.py` matchers learn `compile.py` (+ tests)

## Cross-Cutting

- [x] merge3 unit tests: converge-identical, one-side, field-recurse, ordered-list conflict, delete-vs-update, orphan edge, unique violation, all-or-nothing (27 tests incl. idempotent canonicalization, object-form edge refs, full-validate rollback, determinism)
- [ ] Integrator human-gate tests: missing-verdict halt, waiver re-run proceeds, validation-fail leaves merge unpushed
- [ ] Determinism tests: double-compile, cross-machine byte-identical
- [ ] Migration idempotency + round-trip test
- [ ] Reproducibility-check red test (synthetic hand-edit) and green test
- [ ] Archive-a-feature dry-run: one feature-shard edit keeps graph + trackers green
- [ ] Story validator passes; tracker validator passes
- [ ] README / getting-started updated

## Required Signoff Roles (Set in Planning)

| Role | Required | Why Required | Set By | Date |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|------|
| Architect | Yes | Owns merge semantics, shard schema, ontology classification, and the ownership-boundary changes; this feature redefines the KG contract. | Architect | 2026-07-04 |
| Quality Engineer | Yes | Validates merge determinism, round-trip proof, taxonomy coverage, and the PR #47 replay evidence. | Architect | 2026-07-04 |
| Code Reviewer | Yes | Reviews merge3/compile/decompile correctness, all-or-nothing semantics, and canonical-serializer safety. | Architect | 2026-07-04 |
| DevOps | Yes | CI reproducibility workflow, `.gitattributes` merge driver, branch-protection changes. | Architect | 2026-07-04 |
| Security Reviewer | No | No auth, secret, or external surface; local planning-doc tooling only. | Architect | 2026-07-04 |

## Story Signoff Provenance

Complete this before moving `Overall Status` to `Done` or `Archived`.

> **Required roles per story:** the roles listed for a story below are exactly those required for
> that story — a role's absence means it is *not required* for that story, not that a signoff is
> missing. QE's required scope is the merge tooling and replay/round-trip evidence (S0001, S0002,
> S0005–S0008); the role/contract stories (S0003, S0009) require Architect + Code Reviewer.
> This is why S0002 has no Architect row (it inherits S0001's merge semantics) and S0003 has no QE
> row. Feature-level closeout still requires every role in "Required Signoff Roles" to hold at least
> one story-level PASS.

| Story | Role | Reviewer | Verdict | Evidence | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| F0006-S0001 | Quality Engineer | quality-engineer (delegated, maintainer-sanctioned session) | PASS | 27/27 merge3 tests green on promoted `main` (converge/one-side/field-recurse/ordered-list/delete-vs-update/orphan/unique/all-or-nothing/idempotent-canonicalization/edge-refs/rollback/determinism); PR #47 replay: 9,656-line noise → 0 conflicts + the 1 known real delta typed | 2026-07-06 | Cross-machine determinism deferred (single-machine verified) |
| F0006-S0001 | Code Reviewer | code-reviewer (delegated) | PASS | `merge3.py`/`kg_common.py` on `main`; all-or-nothing via atomic tmp+rename; typed taxonomy complete; edge-ref definitions-vs-references fix (cd2c692) reviewed with regression tests | 2026-07-06 | `--full-validate` transient-write window documented in scripts/kg README; `--validate-cmd` naive .split() noted |
| F0006-S0001 | Architect | architect (delegated) | PASS | Merge semantics conform to PRD §7 tables; canonical serializer idempotent on all 3 curated files; canonicalization commit ID-level no-change proven (a718046); ORDERED_LIST_FIELDS registry matches schema | 2026-07-06 | — |
| F0006-S0002 | Quality Engineer | quality-engineer (delegated) | PASS | 18/18 tracker tests green on `main`; PR #47 tracker replay reproduced the PM-published union (F0038 above F0021, date-desc/ID-desc); rendering idempotence verified | 2026-07-06 | — |
| F0006-S0002 | Code Reviewer | code-reviewer (delegated) | PASS | `tracker_merge.py` reuses S0001 engine (no duplicated merge logic); per-table config incl. manual-order weave; STORY-INDEX rejection; fail-loud on unconfigured tables/unkeyed rows | 2026-07-06 | Prose unions during the train were maintainer-delegate weaves recorded per evidence run (PM-routed by design) |
| F0006-S0003 | Architect | architect (delegated) | PASS | Contract shipped (SKILL/integrate.md/agent-map/templates/runbook, 1cacb7e); 7-PR train executed: 10 evidence runs, 2 halts routed per taxonomy (22 stale-record DivergentInserts → fixup; real ADR-029 collision → architect renumber to ADR-031); both human gates recorded every run; promotion e2f78be | 2026-07-06 | Gate-1 missing-verdict halt never exercised live (train-wide waiver used); gate-2 fail path never exercised (all passes) — both remain contract-text-only, revisit in first post-train integration |
| F0006-S0003 | Code Reviewer | code-reviewer (delegated) | PASS | integrate.md I0–I6 procedure matches executed runs; evidence template fields all populated in 10 real runs; branch strategy (never `main`) held — `main` touched only by promotion merge | 2026-07-06 | Integration ran operator-driven (Claude as integrator + maintainer gates), not yet via the operator prompt end-to-end |

## Deferred Non-Blocking Follow-ups

| Follow-up | Why deferred | Tracking link | Owner |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Roll compiler + shard migration to other product repos | Each repo adopts independently after the reference implementation is proven | TBD | Framework maintainer |
| Re-evaluate OmniGraph (or similar) if live multi-agent graph writes are ever needed | Out of scope; serial integrator suffices at current scale | TBD | Architect |
| Central `F####` reservation tooling for contributors | Process rule suffices now (REGISTRY reservation before branching) | TBD | PM |
| Exercise S0003's two untested human-gate paths (gate-1 missing-verdict halt; gate-2 validation-fail leaves the merge unpushed) in the first post-train integration | Train-wide feature-review waiver + all-pass validations meant neither path ran live; both remain contract-text-only (see S0003 provenance note) | TBD | Maintainer + Quality Engineer |

## Closeout Summary

| Field | Value |
