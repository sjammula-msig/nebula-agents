# F0006-S0003 - Integrator Role and `integrate` Action

## Story Header

**Story ID:** F0006-S0003
**Feature:** F0006 - Compiled Knowledge-Graph Projection and Governed Integration
**Title:** Integrator role and `integrate` action
**Priority:** Critical
**Phase:** Platform Hardening (Feature Phase A)

## User Story

**As a** maintainer on a personal GitHub account (no merge queue, no bot accounts)
**I want** a dedicated integrator agent — with a persona, an `integrate` action, agent-map wiring, and an evidence contract — that I run serially at merge time
**So that** integration has a sanctioned owner: sources merge semantically, projections regenerate unconditionally, validation gates the merge, every run leaves auditable evidence, and no role ever needs an off-book edit again.

## Context & Background

The framework assigns per-feature ownership (PM = WHAT, architect = HOW) but no role owns
"reconcile with a mainline that moved": F0038's closeout needed an off-book PM repoint, and PR #47's
conflict resolution had no sanctioned owner. GitHub-side fixes (merge queue, bot ownership of
generated files) are unavailable on a personal account — and unnecessary: one maintainer running
one agent serially provides the same serialization, and the agent being the sole writer of
generated files on the mainline provides the same ownership.

The integrator is deliberately **mechanical**. It converges provable equivalences, recompiles,
validates, and reports — it never makes semantic decisions. That hard boundary is what makes it
safe to run routinely and what keeps architect/PM authority intact.

Two **human gates** bracket every run (maintainer decision, 2026-07-05). Gate 1, before the run:
the branch's feature carries a passing `feature-review` verdict (done-review), or the maintainer
records an explicit waiver with rationale. Gate 2, after the run: the prepared merge pauses for
the maintainer's test validation — exercise the feature on the merge worktree, record pass/fail —
before anything is pushed. The integrator enforces gate 1 and stops at gate 2; it performs
neither review itself.

Integration lands on a designated **integration branch**, never directly on `main` (maintainer
decision, 2026-07-05). For this first train that branch is the existing `chore/merge-PRs` — the
de facto mainline, well ahead of a stale `main` — and `main` receives only the single promotion
merge after the train completes. In steady state the integrator **creates a dedicated integration
branch per train** rather than reusing a maintainer branch; `integrate.md` documents the branch
strategy and the promotion rule.

Its first production runs are the 7-PR merge train in `nebula-insurance-crm`
(#47 → #51 → #50/#48/#49 → #53/#54; #51 stacks on #47; #53 (F0022) and #54 (F0008) joined
2026-07-04 with the identical KG/tracker footprint). Pre-compiler, "recompile" means: `merge3.py` the
curated trio (S0001) + tracker rows (S0002), then regenerate all derived outputs
(`symbols.py`, `decisions.py`, `--write-coverage-report`, `generate-story-index.py`).

## Acceptance Criteria

**Happy Path:**
- **Given** a contributor branch with clean code merge, independent KG/tracker additions, and a
  passing `feature-review` verdict
- **When** the maintainer runs the `integrate` action against it
- **Then** the agent merges sources (git + merge3), regenerates every generated output
  unconditionally, runs full validation green, writes an integration evidence run, and leaves a
  prepared merge commit paused for the maintainer's test validation — having made **no authoring
  edit** to a source file (only mechanical merge3/tracker convergence of the curated KG trio and
  tracker tables) and having written **no** feature doc or `kg-source/` shard. The push happens
  only after the maintainer records a validation pass.

**Bounce path:**
- **Given** a branch whose committed generated outputs don't match regeneration from its own
  sources (Phase A: derived files stale relative to curated files; Phase B: reproducibility fail)
- **When** the integrator verifies the branch
- **Then** it stops before merging, emits a bounce report telling the contributor exactly what to
  regenerate, and the evidence run records the bounce. The integrator does not fix the branch.

**Conflict-routing path:**
- **Given** merge3 reports a `DivergentUpdate` on a `capability:` node
- **When** the integration runs
- **Then** the run halts with the conflict report addressed to the **architect**, the evidence run
  records it, and nothing is merged. (PM-owned kinds route to the PM identically.)

**Missing-review path (gate 1):**
- **Given** a branch with no `feature-review` verdict and no recorded waiver
- **When** the maintainer starts the `integrate` action against it
- **Then** the run halts before merging anything, names the missing gate, and the evidence run
  records the halt. A maintainer waiver with rationale, recorded in the run inputs, lets a re-run
  proceed; a waiver applies to that run only.

**Human-validation path (gate 2):**
- **Given** a prepared merge commit from a green integration run
- **When** the maintainer exercises the feature on the merge worktree and finds a functional defect
- **Then** nothing is pushed; the validation failure is recorded in the evidence run and routed
  like a bounce (contributor or owning role fixes); any later re-run is a new run.

**Alternative Flows / Edge Cases:**
- Textually clean git merge of generated files → still regenerated (never trusted); test proves a
  poisoned "clean" merge is overwritten by regeneration.
- Stacked PR (#51 ⊇ #47): after #47 lands, integrating #51 replays only the delta.
- Validation failure *after* a clean semantic merge (e.g. orphaned binding) → halt, evidence, route.
- Evidence runs are append-only with unique run IDs; a re-run after a bounce is a **new** run.
- The integrator never pushes to the mainline; the prepared merge is the maintainer's to push.
- Code conflicts are surfaced as ordinary git conflicts for the maintainer/contributor — the
  integrator does not resolve code.

## Interaction Contract

| Surface / Entry Point | User Action | Editable State | Save / Mutation Result | Reload / Persistence Evidence | Roles / Status Constraints |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `agents/actions/integrate.md` via operator prompt | Maintainer starts an integration run naming the source branch/PR | Local merge worktree only | Prepared merge commit + evidence run, or halt report | Evidence run dir persists; re-run creates a new run | Maintainer-invoked only; serial (one run at a time) |
| `integrate` gate-1 check (run inputs) | Maintainer supplies the feature-review verdict reference, or a waiver + rationale | Run inputs only | Run proceeds, or halts naming the missing gate | Verdict/waiver reference persisted in the evidence run | Waivers are maintainer-only; one run each |
| Prepared merge worktree (gate 2) | Maintainer exercises the feature and records the test-validation outcome | None (read-only validation) | Pass → maintainer pushes; fail → recorded and routed like a bounce | Validation outcome persisted in the evidence run | Push blocked until a recorded pass |

## Data Requirements

**Agent registration (`agents/agent-map.yaml`):**
- `integrator`: reads everything; writes limited to generated outputs
  (`{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/**` generated files, `STORY-INDEX.md`, tracker
  generated-table regions), merge-worktree state, and its evidence run dir. Explicit non-writes:
  `kg-source/**`, `features/**` docs, code.

**Integration evidence run contents:**
- Inputs (PR/branch, merge base, mainline SHA, feature-review verdict reference or waiver +
  rationale), merge3/tracker reports (JSON), regeneration command log, validator outputs,
  bounce/conflict reports, prepared-merge SHA, human test-validation outcome, operator identity,
  timestamps (evidence only — never in committed projections).

**Validation Rules:**
- A run that writes any feature doc or `kg-source/` shard, or makes an authoring
  (non-mechanical-merge) change to the curated KG trio / tracker tables, must abort and self-report
  (contract violation). Mechanical merge3/tracker convergence of the curated trio and tracker rows
  is *not* an authoring change and is permitted (it is the integrator's Phase-A merge function).
- Every halt names the owning role and the exact records/fields at issue.

## Role-Based Visibility

**Roles that can run / are bound by this action:**
- Maintainer — sole invoker; runs the integrator serially, owns both human gates, pushes the
  prepared merge.
- Integrator (agent) — executes the run; sole writer of generated files on the mainline; never
  authors source (hard boundary).
- Architect / PM — receive routed semantic collisions (architect: nodes/bindings/policies/ontology;
  PM: features/trackers; co-sign: exclusions).

**Data Visibility:** N/A — operates on a local merge worktree and appends evidence runs; no
server-side auth surface and no internal/external data exposure. The agent's write scope is
constrained in `agents/agent-map.yaml` (generated outputs + evidence dir only).

## Dependencies

**Depends On:** F0006-S0001 (merge3), F0006-S0002 (tracker merge).
**Related Stories:** F0006-S0008 (CI mirrors the branch-reproducibility check), F0006-S0009
(contract docs describe this role), F0005-derived duties absorbed via Phase B stories.

## Business Rules

1. **Serial by construction:** one integration run at a time; the maintainer is the serializer.
2. **Sole writer:** on the mainline, only integrator runs (or explicit maintainer override) may
   change generated files.
3. **Never authors sources:** any *authored* source change needed = semantic collision = route to
   owner (architect: nodes/bindings/policies/ontology; PM: features/trackers; co-sign: exclusions).
   Mechanical merge3/tracker convergence of the curated trio and tracker rows is not authoring.
4. **Unconditional regeneration:** clean git merges of generated files are never trusted.
5. **Bounce, don't fix:** contributor branches stay contributor-owned.
6. **Evidence always:** merged, bounced, or halted — every run leaves an append-only record.
7. **Human gates bracket the run:** no integration starts without a feature-review verdict or a
   recorded maintainer waiver; no prepared merge is pushed without a recorded maintainer test
   validation. Both outcomes live in the evidence run.
8. **Integration branch, never `main`:** prepared merges are pushed to the designated integration
   branch (`chore/merge-PRs` for the Phase-A train; a dedicated integrator-created branch per
   train in steady state). `main` receives only the maintainer's promotion merge.

## Out of Scope

- The compiler and reproducibility CI (Phase B) — the integrator's Phase B upgrades land with them.
- Automating the maintainer's push. Multi-repo orchestration. Code-conflict resolution.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- A no-conflict integration completes in minutes; the agent's context stays within one run.
- Deterministic: re-running a bounced integration after the fix produces the same merge result.

## Questions & Assumptions

**Open Questions:**
- [x] Model tier for the integrator in `agent-map.yaml`: **decided `balanced`** (2026-07-05) —
      the work is mechanical tool invocation + report assembly; no semantic decisions.
- [x] Evidence home in the product repo: **decided** (2026-07-05) — the standard base-run profile
      at `planning-mds/operations/evidence/runs/integrate-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` plus
      `integration-report.json` and per-file merge reports (template:
      `agents/templates/integration-evidence-template.md`). No new root; keeps integration runs
      out of feature-package validation (incl. the 2026-07-05 KG-regeneration rules, which key
      off feature evidence manifests).

**Assumptions (to be validated):**
- The seven open PRs' code merges stay clean (verified for #47 and by overlap scan for #48–#51 at
  review time; #53/#54 still need the same overlap scan; re-verify at each integration).

## Definition of Done

- [x] `agents/integrator/SKILL.md`, `agents/actions/integrate.md`,
      `agents/templates/prompts/evidence-contract/integrate-operator-friendly.md`, integration
      evidence template, `agent-map.yaml` registration, `actions/README.md` + `ROUTER.md` routing
- [x] Acceptance criteria met including the poisoned-clean-merge test and a full dry run on PR #47
- [ ] Human-gate tests: missing-verdict halt, waiver re-run proceeds, validation-fail leaves the
      merge unpushed and recorded — *waiver re-run was exercised across the train; the
      missing-verdict halt and validation-fail paths remain deferred (see STATUS "Deferred
      Non-Blocking Follow-ups")*
- [x] Both human gates documented in `integrate.md` and `MANUAL-ORCHESTRATION-RUNBOOK.md`; the
      evidence template carries verdict/waiver and test-validation-outcome fields
- [x] Branch strategy documented in `integrate.md`: integration-branch target (never `main`),
      `main`-promotion rule, steady-state dedicated-branch creation by the integrator
- [x] The 7-PR merge train executed: 7 merges, 9 evidence runs (dry-runs, halts, and re-runs each
      leave an append-only run), mainline green after each
      (tracked as the feature's Phase-A exit in `STATUS.md`; later arrivals join the same train)
- [ ] Contract-violation self-abort test (attempted source edit aborts the run) — *deferred with
      the human-gate tests above*
- [x] Story filename matches `Story ID` prefix
- [x] Story index regenerated or updated
