# Action: Review

## User Intent

Perform comprehensive code quality and security review on implemented features or the entire codebase with approval gates.

## Agent Flow

```
(Code Reviewer + Security)
  ↓ [Parallel Reviews]
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews findings and decides next steps]
  ↓
Review Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Parallel reviews with single approval gate

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates review flow and gate decisions; it remains stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/lint/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Review gate decisions must reference evidence generated from those application runtime executions.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parallel Reviews

**Execution Instructions:**

Execute these review agents **in parallel**:

#### 1a. Code Reviewer
1. **Activate Code Reviewer agent** by reading `agents/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`

2. **Read context:**
   - Source code (backend, frontend, and `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/neuron/` when AI scope exists)
   - Test suites
   - Application runtime validation outputs (test, lint, SAST, dependency scan reports)
   - Coverage artifacts and any explicit layer-skip justifications
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (requirements and architecture)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - `agents/frontend-developer/references/ux-audit-ruleset.md` (for frontend UX compliance checks)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria

3. **Execute code review:**
   - Review code structure and organization
   - Check SOLID principles adherence
   - Validate clean architecture boundaries
   - Review test coverage and quality
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Check naming conventions and readability
   - Validate acceptance criteria mapping
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Check for over-engineering or under-engineering
   - Validate SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md compliance
   - Validate frontend UX rule-set compliance when UI code changed
   - Treat a non-obvious change without `// WHY:` (or language equivalent) as a blocker
   - If inline decision markers changed, require `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-decisions --check-decisions` evidence
   - When `coverage-report.yaml` carries Phase 3 freshness signals, apply hotspot/ownership gates per touched node:
     - `hotspot_rank` ≤ 5 (or `hotspot_score` ≥ 0.80) → require explicit second-reviewer evidence
     - `bus_factor_flag: true` → require `primary_owner` acknowledgement on the PR
     - Thresholds and examples: `agents/architect/references/hotspot-review-guide.md`
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/risk.py <node-id|--file|--symbol>` for each touched canonical node and apply the risk gates:
     - `kg.risk` ≥ 7 (high band) → require an additional reviewer beyond the PR author
     - `kg.risk` ≥ 9 (critical band) → require a `workstate.py decision --topic risk-acknowledgement` entry referenced from the PR before merge
     - Treat each `reviewer_recommendations[]` entry as a checklist item; weights/bands live in `agents/architect/references/risk-scoring-guide.md`
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/diff-impact.py <pr-range>` and attach the `affected_nodes` list to the review notes. Surface canonical nodes the PR description did not anticipate as a discussion item — not an auto-fail (new internal helpers can legitimately have zero callers until the calling code lands).
   - For symbol *names* the diff introduces or moves, run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/lookup.py --defines <name>` to detect duplicate or near-duplicate surface elsewhere in the codebase.

4. **Produce code review report:**

   Detailed Reports:
   - Code Quality Review: [link/location]
   - Security Review: [link/location]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Compute gate state from combined findings:**
   ```
   total_critical = code_critical + security_critical
   total_high = code_high + security_high
   total_medium = code_medium + security_medium
   total_low = code_low + security_low

   IF required_runtime_evidence_missing:
     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     OPTIONS: ["Generate Missing Evidence", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF total_critical > 0:
     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     OPTIONS: ["Fix Critical", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF total_high > 0:
     STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
     OPTIONS: ["Fix All High (Recommended)", "Approve with Justification", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true (requires justification)

   ELSE:
     STATUS: ✓ ACCEPTABLE
     OPTIONS: ["Approve", "Fix Issues Anyway", "Reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true
   ```

3. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Review Approval Checklist:
   - [ ] No critical code quality issues
   - [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
   - [ ] High-severity issues fixed OR approved with mitigation justification
   - [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance acceptable

   - [ ] Coverage/test evidence includes artifact paths and any layer exceptions are justified
   - [ ] Authorization correctly implemented
   - [ ] Audit logging complete
   ```

4. **Present gate options by state:**
   - **If BLOCKED (critical findings exist):**
     - Options: `"fix critical"`, `"reject"`
     - Do not present any approve option.
   - **If WARNING (no critical, one or more high):**
     - Options: `"fix all high"`, `"approve with justification"`, `"reject"`
   - **If ACCEPTABLE (no critical/high):**
     - Options: `"approve"`, `"fix issues anyway"`, `"reject"`

5. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "fix critical":**
     - Identify critical issues (code + security)
     - Developers fix critical issues
     - Return to Step 1 (re-run reviews)

   - **If "fix all high" or "fix issues anyway":**
     - Identify selected issues
     - Developers fix issues
     - Return to Step 1 (re-run reviews)

   - **If "approve with justification":**
     - Capture explicit mitigation justification for remaining high issues
     - Log decision and mitigation plan
     - Proceed to Step 3 (Review Complete)

   - **If "approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 3 (Review Complete)

   - **If "reject":**
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to implementation
     - Full rebuild required

   - **If user input is not in the current state's allowed options:**
     - Do not transition
     - Re-present current state and allowed options

5. **Machine-readable gate state:**

   Orchestrators must be able to programmatically determine gate state:

   ```json
   {
     "gate": "review",
     "status": "blocked" | "warning" | "acceptable",
     "findings": {
       "code_quality": {
         "critical": 0,
         "high": 1,
         "medium": 2,
         "low": 3
       },
       "security": {
         "critical": 0,
         "high": 0,
         "medium": 1,
         "low": 2
       }
     },
     "totals": {
       "critical": 0,
       "high": 1,
       "medium": 3,
       "low": 5
     },
     "can_approve": true,
     "requires_justification": true,
     "available_actions": ["fix_all_high", "approve_with_justification", "reject"],
     "blocking_issues": []
   }
   ```

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Both reviews completed
- [ ] Combined critical issues = 0 before approval is enabled
- [ ] Any high-issue approval includes explicit mitigation justification
- [ ] User decision logged with rationale when required

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Clean Review with Approval
```
User: "Run the review action on the customer feature"

[Step 1: Parallel reviews]
Code Reviewer:
  - No critical issues
  - 2 medium issues (naming conventions)
  - Test coverage: 87%
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

Security:
  - No vulnerabilities
  - OWASP Top 10: 10/10 passed
  - Authorization: Correct
  - Recommendation: PASS

[Step 2: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Review complete.
  Code: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS (2 medium issues)
  Security: PASS

  Do you want to take action? (approve/fix issues anyway/reject)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Review approved! Code ready to merge."
```

### Scenario 2: Critical Security Issue
```
User: "Run the review action on order processing workflow"

[Step 1: Parallel reviews]
Code Reviewer:
  - 1 high issue (missing error handling)
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES

Security:
  - 1 CRITICAL issue (SQL injection vulnerability in search)
  - 2 high issues (missing authorization checks)
  - Recommendation: FIX CRITICAL

[Step 2: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Review complete.
  Code: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS
  Security: FAIL (1 critical vulnerability)

  CRITICAL: SQL injection in customer search endpoint
  Location: CustomerController.cs:45
  Must fix before deployment!

  What action? (fix critical/reject)"

User: "fix critical"

Agent Runtime: "Fixing SQL injection vulnerability..."
[Backend Developer fixes using parameterized queries]

Agent Runtime: "Issue fixed. Running security review again..."
[Security re-reviews]

Agent Runtime: "Security review: WARNING. Critical issue resolved; 2 high issues remain.
  What action? (fix all high/approve with justification/reject)"

User: "approve with justification"

Agent Runtime: "Justification recorded. Review approved with mitigation plan."
```

---

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [build action](./build.md) or [feature action](./feature.md) - Implement first
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Document after approval
- **Part of:** [build action](./build.md) includes review as Phase 2

---

## Notes

- Review action can be run on any scope (feature, PR, full codebase)
- Both reviews run in parallel for efficiency
- Critical issues must be fixed before approval
- Review reports should be saved for tracking
- Reviews can be re-run after changes
- User has final decision on approval within gate constraints (agents recommend, user decides)
- Automated tools can supplement but not replace agent reviews
