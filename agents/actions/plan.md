# Action: Plan

## User Intent

Complete planning phase (Phase A + B) by defining product requirements,
technical architecture, and the feature's solution-ontology bindings with
mandatory approval and synchronization gates.

## Agent Flow

```
Product Manager (Phase A)
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews requirements]
  ↓
Architect (Phase B)
  ↓
[ONTOLOGY SYNC GATE: Feature mapping and canonical bindings aligned]
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews architecture]
  ↓
Ready for Build
```

**Flow Type:** Sequential with approval and synchronization gates

## Retrieval Contract

Retuned by `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/eval.py`; do not hand-edit without running eval.

```yaml
tier_defaults:
  plan:
    greenfield:      { start_tier: file-centric, max_auto_tier: 2 }
    refinement:      { start_tier: 2,            max_auto_tier: 3 }
    drift-reconcile: { start_tier: 3,            max_auto_tier: 4 }
```

- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/lookup.py <feature-id>` is a first-pass scope resolver and retrieval aid, not an authoritative source of truth.
- Raw artifacts win on conflict: feature folder, ADRs, API contracts, schemas, and policy artifacts outrank KG output.
- Navigate instead of eager-loading: open linked raw artifacts on demand when the current gate needs detail or drift repair.

## Context Files

Load in this order when the work is feature-scoped:

1. `agents/ROUTER.md`
2. `agents/agent-map.yaml`
3. `agents/docs/AGENT-USE.md`
4. `agents/actions/plan.md`
5. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`
6. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`
7. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
8. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/code-index.yaml`
9. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/coverage-report.yaml`
10. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/**` when the feature folder exists

## On-Demand Paths

- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/<openapi-spec>.yaml`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/authorization-matrix.md`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/policies/policy.csv`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/*.yaml` beyond what `lookup.py` already returned
- `agents/<role>/references/**` only after a matching `agents/ROUTER.md` row

## Deliverables Contract

- PM artifacts: `PRD.md`, stories, personas, trackers, feature folder scaffolding, and feature mapping stubs
- Architect artifacts: data model, workflow design, API contracts, ADRs, authorization deltas, and completed KG bindings
- KG artifacts: `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`, plus `canonical-nodes.yaml` or `solution-ontology.yaml` only when shared semantics or ontology vocabulary changed
- Tracker artifacts: `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md`, `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md`, `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md`, and generated story index as needed
- `feature-assembly-plan.md` is not a plan deliverable; it belongs to `agents/actions/feature.md` Step 0

## Ownership Contract

- `product-manager` owns `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`, stories, PRD, personas, and planning trackers
- `architect` owns `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`, `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`, ADRs, API contracts, schemas, and authorization artifacts
- Other roles flag drift but do not silently redefine canonical shared semantics

## Forbidden

- Hand-enumerating schemas, ADRs, or contract files when `lookup.py` output is already available
- Loading `agents/<role>/references/**` without a `agents/ROUTER.md` row match
- Treating lookup/KG mappings as authoritative over raw artifacts
- Non-architect roles editing `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml` or `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`
- Proceeding past any gate without an explicit approval token
- Widening scope outside the current feature or declared plan target
- Climbing past `max_auto_tier` without recording `workstate.py escalate`

## Gate Contract

- `G1 CLARIFICATION` — Step 1.5 Requirements Clarification
- `G2 TRACKER SYNC (A)` — Step 1.75 Mandatory tracker synchronization before Phase A approval
- `G3 PHASE A APPROVAL` — Step 2 Phase A Review
- `G4 ONTOLOGY SYNC (B)` — Step 3.5 Mandatory ontology synchronization before Phase B approval
- `G5 PHASE B APPROVAL` — Step 4 Phase B Review

## Stop Conditions

- `validate.py` exits non-zero and cannot be repaired within the declared scope
- A required approval gate lacks an explicit approval token
- Scope drifts outside the declared feature or planning target
- A non-architect attempts to edit architect-owned canonical semantics
- `INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT`: `lookup.py` returns empty scope for a declared in-scope node, or only ambiguous / low-confidence (`inferred`, `confidence < 0.5`) matches on a node about to be edited, or the workflow needs to climb past `max_auto_tier`; halt the current gate, invoke `workstate.py escalate <reason> --nodes ... --opened-raw ...`, open the raw artifacts, and do not proceed with weak matches

## Exit Validation

Run in this order:

1. `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-stories.py {FEATURE_PATH}`
2. `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`
3. `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --skip-feature-evidence`
4. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report`
5. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py`
6. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift`
7. `python3 agents/scripts/validate_templates.py`

Plan closeout is tracker/base-run validation only. Do not run
`validate-feature-evidence.py` for the current plan run, and do not run
repo-wide feature-evidence validation as a plan closeout gate. Identify direct
or impacted feature dependencies from planning artifacts and KG mappings, then
record existing dependency evidence references or "audit pending" notes in the
plan run evidence. Automated dependency discovery/validator support is a later
contract step.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Execute Product Manager (Phase A)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Product Manager agent** by reading `agents/product-manager/SKILL.md`

2. **Read required context:**
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (Sections 0-2 for baseline context)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/domain/` (domain glossary, if exists)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/` (shared ontology context, if present)

3. **Execute Product Manager responsibilities:**
   - Define vision and explicit non-goals
   - Create personas representing target users
   - Decompose vision into epics and features
   - Write user stories with clear acceptance criteria
   - Specify screen list and responsibilities
   - Map key workflows across screens
   - Produce ASCII screen layouts in the PRD `## Screen Layouts (ASCII)` section whenever the feature introduces or materially modifies a user-visible screen or multi-step flow (Desktop + one narrow variant minimum). Skip only when the feature has no UI surface; record the reason in the section.
   - Seed a minimal feature mapping stub in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml` for any new or materially changed feature in scope

4. **Produce outputs:**
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Section 3 (complete, no TODOs)
   - Create `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/examples/personas/*.md` (if detailed personas needed)
   - Create feature folders at `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/` with PRD.md, README.md, STATUS.md, GETTING-STARTED.md
   - Create stories colocated in feature folders as `F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - Create or update a minimal feature mapping stub in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
   - Ensure `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/TRACKER-GOVERNANCE.md` exists (copy from `agents/templates/tracker-governance-template.md` if missing)
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` with new features
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` with sequence changes (`Now / Next / Later / Completed`)

5. **Validate Phase A outputs:**
   - [ ] Vision and non-goals documented
   - [ ] Personas defined
   - [ ] Features listed with MVP prioritization
   - [ ] User stories have acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Screen responsibilities specified
   - [ ] ASCII screen layouts present in `## Screen Layouts (ASCII)` for every UI-bearing feature (Desktop + narrow variant), or a written "No UI" justification if omitted
   - [ ] Mutation stories include interaction contracts and distinguish display-only/read-only behavior from editable save behavior
   - [ ] Minimal ontology stub exists for each touched feature (`id`, `path`, `status`, obvious dependencies/high-confidence affected nodes)
   - [ ] No invented business rules (all traced to user needs)
   - [ ] No TODOs remain in Section 3

**Phase A Outputs:**
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Section 3 (complete)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/examples/personas/` (optional)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/` (feature folders with PRD, README, STATUS, GETTING-STARTED, and story files)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml` (minimal feature/story stub for touched scope)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` (feature index)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` (prioritization/sequence view)

---

### Step 1.5: CLARIFICATION GATE (Requirements Clarification)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Review Phase A outputs for underspecified areas:**

   Read through all Phase A deliverables and identify:
   - Vague acceptance criteria (no numbers, no specifics)
   - Ambiguous language ("should", "might", "probably", "easy", "fast", "secure")
   - Missing edge cases or error scenarios
   - Undefined dependencies
   - Unstated assumptions
   - Features without clear success criteria
   - Mutation language (`capture`, `edit`, `save`, `update`, `manage`, `submit`, `approve`, `assign`, `transition`) without an interaction contract that names entry points, editable/read-only states, persistence evidence, roles, lifecycle/status constraints, validation failures, and audit/timeline expectations
   - Phrases like "display or capture", "view or edit", or "manage" that allow render-only implementation to satisfy a save/edit requirement

2. **Identify specific issues:**

   Create a list of underspecified areas with specific questions:

   ```markdown
   ## Requirements Clarification Needed

   ### Vague Acceptance Criteria

   **Story:** "Customer search should be fast"
   **Issue:** "Fast" is not measurable
   **Questions:**
   - How fast is "fast"? (< 200ms? < 1s? < 5s?)
   - For how many results? (100? 1000? 10000?)
   - What's acceptable if it's slower?

   **Story:** "Users can upload documents"
   **Issues:** Missing specifications
   **Questions:**
   - What file types allowed? (PDF, images, Office docs, all?)
   - Max file size? (1MB? 10MB? 100MB?)
   - What happens if upload fails? (retry? error message?)
   - Where are files stored? (database? blob storage?)
   - Virus scanning required?

   ### Ambiguous Language

   **Story:** "Dashboard should be intuitive"
   **Issue:** "Intuitive" is subjective
   **Questions:**
   - What specific widgets/data on dashboard?
   - What actions can users take from dashboard?
   - What defines "success" for this dashboard?

   ### Missing Edge Cases

   **Feature:** "Customer list with pagination"
   **Questions:**
   - What happens with empty list (no customers)?
   - Default page size? (10? 20? 50?)
   - Max page size?
   - What happens on last page with < full page?

   ### Unstated Assumptions

   **Feature:** "Email notifications"
   **Questions:**
   - Who sends emails? (system? specific user?)
   - When are emails sent? (immediate? batched?)
   - What if email fails to send?
   - Unsubscribe option required?

   ### Mutation / Interaction Contract Gaps

   **Story:** "Users can display or capture product attributes"
   **Issues:** "Display or capture" can be implemented as read-only rendering without an enabled save path
   **Questions:**
   - Which exact screens and entry points must be editable, not just visible?
   - Which lifecycle states and roles allow editing?
   - What user action starts editing, and what controls are required (Edit, Save, Cancel, Submit, etc.)?
   - What backend write path or system mutation must occur?
   - What proves persistence after save (reload, query invalidation, timeline event, downstream state)?
   - What happens for legacy, archived, terminal, or otherwise read-only records?
   ```

3. **Ask user for clarifications:**

   Present the clarification questions to the user:

   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Requirements Clarification Needed
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Phase A requirements have [count] underspecified areas that
   need clarification before proceeding to architecture design.

   [List questions by category]

   Please provide answers to these questions, or indicate if
   any should be deferred to architecture phase.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

4. **Update Phase A outputs with clarifications:**

   - Update user stories with specific, quantified acceptance criteria
   - Remove ambiguous language
   - Add edge cases and error scenarios
   - Document assumptions explicitly
   - Add dependencies to stories

5. **Validate clarifications are complete:**

   **Testability Check:**
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
   - [ ] No ambiguous words remain ("should" → "must", "fast" → "< 200ms")
   - [ ] All performance requirements quantified
   - [ ] Error scenarios specified for each story
   - [ ] Edge cases identified

   **Completeness Check:**
   - [ ] All dependencies documented
   - [ ] All assumptions explicit
   - [ ] File upload/download specs complete (types, sizes, errors)
   - [ ] Notification specs complete (when, who, how, failures)
   - [ ] Search/filter specs complete (fields, operators, performance)
   - [ ] Every mutation story has an interaction contract: screen/entry point, action, editable state, save result, persistence evidence, role/status rules, validation failure, and audit/timeline expectation
   - [ ] Any story containing "display or capture", "view or edit", or "manage" has been split or clarified so read-only rendering cannot accidentally satisfy editable behavior

**Anti-Patterns to Catch:**

Banned words that indicate vagueness:
- ❌ "should", "might", "probably", "usually", "generally"
- ❌ "easy", "simple", "intuitive", "user-friendly"
- ❌ "fast", "quick", "slow", "performant", "responsive"
- ❌ "secure", "safe", "protected" (without specifics)
- ❌ "scalable", "flexible", "robust" (without metrics)
- ❌ "display or capture", "view or edit", "manage" (without separate read and mutation requirements)
- ❌ "save" or "update" (without entry point, role/status, validation, persistence, and audit/timeline expectations)

Replace with:
- ✅ "must" (requirement), "may" (optional)
- ✅ Specific metrics ("< 200ms p95", "≥ 80% success rate")
- ✅ Explicit error handling ("show error: 'File too large'")
- ✅ Quantified criteria ("support 10,000 concurrent users")
- ✅ Explicit interaction contracts ("Policy Detail entered from Policy List -> Edit -> Save -> persisted after reload; allowed for Pending only; emits PolicyUpdated")

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] All underspecified areas identified
- [ ] User provided clarifications
- [ ] Phase A outputs updated with specifics
- [ ] No ambiguous language remains
- [ ] All acceptance criteria testable
- [ ] Edge cases and errors documented
- [ ] All mutation stories include interaction contracts and cannot pass with render-only tests unless explicitly read-only

**If Clarifications Complete:**
- Proceed to Step 2 (Approval Gate)

**If User Defers Some Questions:**
- Document as "Architect to decide" with rationale
- Proceed to Step 2

---

### Step 1.75: TRACKER SYNC GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Before Phase A approval, synchronize and validate planning trackers:

1. Ensure tracker updates are complete:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/TRACKER-GOVERNANCE.md` exists and reflects required signoff governance
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` reflects feature inventory and paths
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` reflects current sequencing
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` feature/story status links resolve
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml` contains a minimal stub for each touched feature

2. Regenerate generated tracker:
   - Run `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`

3. Validate trackers and stories:
   - Run `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-stories.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/` for each touched feature
   - Run `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --skip-feature-evidence`

4. Prepare dependency evidence audit:
   - Identify direct or impacted feature dependencies from the PRD, architecture notes, `feature-mappings.yaml`, and KG lookup output
   - Cite any existing approved dependency evidence references, or record "audit pending" when no dependency evidence check is available yet
   - Do not run repo-wide feature-evidence validation to satisfy this plan gate

5. If validation fails:
   - Fix tracker drift immediately
   - Re-run all validation commands until passing

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Tracker governance contract exists
- [ ] Story index regenerated after story file changes
- [ ] Story validation passes
- [ ] Tracker validation passes
- [ ] Direct/impacted dependency evidence references or audit-pending notes recorded
- [ ] Minimal feature mapping stub present for touched planning scope
- [ ] No stale links/paths/status mismatches across tracker docs

---

### Step 2: APPROVAL GATE (Phase A Review)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Present Phase A outputs to user:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Phase A Complete - Requirements Definition
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   ✓ Vision & Non-goals
     - Vision: [1-2 sentence summary]
     - Non-goals: [count] explicit exclusions

   ✓ Personas
     - [count] personas created
     - Primary: [list primary personas]

   ✓ Features & Epics
     - [count] features defined
     - MVP scope: [list MVP features]
     - Future scope: [list deferred features]

   ✓ User Stories
     - [count] stories written
     - Acceptance criteria: All stories have testable criteria

   ✓ Screens
     - [count] screens specified
     - Key workflows: [list main workflows]

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Review the following files:
   - {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md (Section 3)
   - {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/examples/personas/ (if created)
   - {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md (feature index)
   - {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/ (feature folders with PRDs and stories)
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Phase A Approval Checklist:
   - [ ] Vision aligns with business goals
   - [ ] Non-goals are explicit and clear
   - [ ] Personas represent actual target users
   - [ ] Features are well-scoped (not too big or too small)
   - [ ] User stories have testable acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Screen responsibilities are clear
   - [ ] ASCII screen layouts present for UI-bearing features (Desktop + narrow variant) or "No UI" justified
   - [ ] No ambiguities or TODOs remain
   - [ ] Scope is realistic for MVP
   ```

3. **Ask user for approval:**
   ```
   Do you approve Phase A (Requirements)?

   Options:
   - "approve" - Proceed to Phase B (Architecture)
   - "reject" - Provide feedback and iterate on Phase A
   - "request changes" - Specify what needs to change
   ```

4. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "approve":**
     - Log approval with timestamp
     - Proceed to Step 3 (Execute Architect)

   - **If "reject" or "request changes":**
     - Ask: "What feedback do you have? What should be changed?"
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to Step 1 with feedback context
     - Product Manager iterates based on feedback
     - Return to Step 2 for re-approval

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Vision and non-goals clear
- [ ] Personas validated with stakeholders
- [ ] Features align with business goals
- [ ] User stories have testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] No TODOs or ambiguities remain
- [ ] User explicitly approves

---

### Context Reset Checkpoint (Phase A → Phase B)

After Phase A is approved (G3) and its outputs are persisted (BLUEPRINT, stories,
trackers, `STATUS.md`), **reset context before starting architecture.** Phase B does not
need Phase A's working context in-window — it rehydrates from the persisted artifacts and
the KG, so carrying the full Phase A context into Phase B is a large cache write over an
already-large prefix (the dominant per-turn cost). The reset is safe precisely because
state is durable outside the window.

- Harness-neutral: `/clear` (Claude Code), a fresh run (OpenAI), or a new operator session
  (manual). Re-enter via Step 3's required-context list + `workstate.py dump`/`digest`.
- Skip only if Phase A context is already small (well under the §13.3 budget).

### Step 3: Execute Architect (Phase B)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Architect agent** by reading `agents/architect/SKILL.md`

2. **Read required context:**
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Sections 0-3 (especially Section 3 - approved requirements)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md` (project-specific patterns to follow)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/domain/` (domain knowledge)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`, `canonical-nodes.yaml`, and `feature-mappings.yaml` (if present)
   - `agents/architect/references/` (generic architecture best practices)

3. **Execute Architect responsibilities:**
   - Validate Phase A deliverables for technical feasibility
   - Define service/module boundaries
   - Design data model (entities, relationships, key attributes)
   - Create API contracts (endpoints, request/response schemas)
   - Define authorization model (roles, resources, actions, policies)
   - Specify workflow state machines and business rules
   - Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
   - Define non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Complete the target feature's ontology mapping in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
   - Add or update canonical shared nodes in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml` when Phase B introduces reusable solution semantics
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml` only if the ontology vocabulary itself must change

4. **Validate against SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md:**
   - [ ] Authorization follows Casbin ABAC pattern
   - [ ] Audit fields included in all entities
   - [ ] API endpoints follow `/api/{resource}/{id}` pattern
   - [ ] Errors use ProblemDetails pattern
   - [ ] Clean architecture layers respected
   - [ ] Workflow transitions are append-only
   - [ ] All mutations create timeline events

5. **Produce outputs:**
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Section 4 (complete, no TODOs)
   - Create `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/decisions/*.md` (ADRs for key decisions)
   - Create `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/data-model.md` (if detailed ERD needed)
   - Create `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/*.yaml` (OpenAPI contracts for implementation)
   - Complete ontology bindings in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
   - Add canonical shared nodes in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml` when needed

6. **Validate Phase B outputs:**
   - [ ] Service boundaries clear
   - [ ] Data model complete with relationships
   - [ ] API contracts defined for all user stories
   - [ ] Authorization model comprehensive
   - [ ] Workflow rules specified
   - [ ] NFRs measurable
   - [ ] ADRs written for key decisions
   - [ ] Feature ontology mapping completed
   - [ ] New shared semantics captured in canonical nodes when applicable
   - [ ] Architecture satisfies all Phase A requirements
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md followed
   - [ ] No TODOs remain in Section 4

**Phase B Outputs:**
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Section 4 (complete)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/decisions/*.md` (ADRs)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/data-model.md` (optional)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/*.yaml` (OpenAPI contracts)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml` (completed feature/story bindings)
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml` (when new shared semantics were introduced)

---

### Step 3.5: ONTOLOGY SYNC GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Before Phase B approval, synchronize and validate the solution ontology for the
touched planning scope:

1. Ensure feature mapping completion:
   - The target feature exists in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
   - Story mappings exist when architecture decisions materially depend on canonical workflow, schema, or ADR links
   - `status`, `path`, and dependency references align with the feature folder and trackers

2. Ensure canonical shared semantics are captured correctly:
   - If the feature only reuses existing shared semantics, reference existing canonical nodes
   - If the feature introduces a new reusable workflow, workflow state, entity, schema grouping, or capability, add it to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`
   - Do not add new canonical nodes for feature-local details that remain owned by the PRD alone

3. Validate source precedence and ownership boundaries:
   - Raw feature, ADR, API, schema, and data-model artifacts remain the authority
   - Product Manager Phase A stubs are not left as the final semantic mapping when Phase B clarified the design
   - Architect-owned canonical bindings are complete before plan closeout

4. Validate ontology integrity:
   - Touched YAML files parse successfully
   - Referenced IDs exist
   - Referenced paths exist
   - No stale or contradictory bindings remain for the touched feature
   - Refresh the coverage report: `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report`
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py` — it MUST exit 0 before the gate passes (stale `coverage-report.yaml`, missing paths, unknown refs, or uncovered feature dirs will fail the gate)

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Target feature has a completed ontology mapping
- [ ] New shared semantics captured in canonical nodes when applicable
- [ ] Mapping references resolve to real IDs and paths
- [ ] Ontology does not contradict raw planning/architecture artifacts
- [ ] Architect has finished ontology updates before plan closeout
- [ ] `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py` exits 0 (coverage report fresh, no integrity errors)

2. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Phase B Approval Checklist:
   - [ ] Architecture satisfies all Phase A requirements
   - [ ] Data model is complete and normalized
   - [ ] API contracts are clear and RESTful
   - [ ] Authorization model is comprehensive
   - [ ] Workflow state machines are well-defined
   - [ ] NFRs are measurable and achievable
   - [ ] ADRs explain key architectural decisions
   - [ ] Ontology mapping is complete and aligned with the architecture
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md patterns are followed
   - [ ] No technical debt or shortcuts
   - [ ] Architecture is implementable
   ```

3. **Ask user for approval:**
   ```
   Do you approve Phase B (Architecture)?

   Options:
   - "approve" - Architecture approved, ready for build action
   - "reject" - Provide feedback and iterate on Phase B
   - "request changes" - Specify what needs to change
   ```

4. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "approve":**
     - Log approval with timestamp
     - Proceed to Step 5 (Plan Complete)

   - **If "reject" or "request changes":**
     - Ask: "What feedback do you have? What should be changed?"
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to Step 3 with feedback context
     - Architect iterates based on feedback
     - Return to Step 4 for re-approval

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Architecture satisfies all requirements
- [ ] Data model complete
- [ ] API contracts clear
- [ ] Authorization model sound
- [ ] Ontology sync complete
- [ ] Follows SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md
- [ ] NFRs measurable
- [ ] User explicitly approves

### Step 5: Plan Complete

**Execution Instructions:**

Present completion summary:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Plan Action Complete! ✓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Phase A (Product Manager):
  ✓ Vision defined
  ✓ [count] personas created
  ✓ [count] features planned (MVP scope)
  ✓ [count] user stories written
  ✓ [count] screens specified
  Status: APPROVED

Phase B (Architect):
  ✓ Data model designed ([count] entities)
  ✓ API contracts specified ([count] endpoints)
  ✓ Authorization model defined
  ✓ [count] workflows specified
  ✓ [count] ADRs documented
  ✓ Ontology mapping synchronized
  ✓ SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md followed
  Status: APPROVED

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Next Steps:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Ready for implementation! You can now:

1. Run the "build" action to implement all MVP features
2. Run the "feature" action to implement one feature at a time
3. Run the "validate" action to double-check alignment

Recommended: Start with "feature" action for incremental delivery

Example: "Run the feature action for [specific feature name]"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Validation Criteria

**Overall Plan Action Success:**
- [ ] Phase A completed and approved by user
- [ ] Phase B completed and approved by user
- [ ] All outputs exist in {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/
- [ ] No TODOs remain in BLUEPRINT.md Sections 3-4
- [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md patterns documented and followed
- [ ] Ontology mapping synchronized for touched feature scope
- [ ] Ready to proceed to build action

---

## Prerequisites

Before running plan action:
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` exists with Sections 0-2 (baseline context)
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/TRACKER-GOVERNANCE.md` exists (or will be created from `agents/templates/tracker-governance-template.md` during this run)
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/` exists or can be created during this run
- [ ] Domain glossary exists or can be created
- [ ] User is available to provide approvals at gates
- [ ] User has clarified business requirements

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Plan New Feature
```
User: "Run the plan action for customer management"

Agent Runtime: [Reads plan.md]
Agent Runtime: "I'll execute Step 1: Product Manager for Phase A..."

[Product Manager executes - defines personas, stories, screens for customer management]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A complete. Outputs:
  - 2 personas (Distribution Manager, Customer Relationship Manager)
  - 5 features (Customer CRUD, Search, Activity Timeline)
  - 15 user stories with acceptance criteria
  - 4 screens (List, Detail, Create/Edit, Search)

Do you approve Phase A? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Proceeding to Step 3: Architect for Phase B..."

[Architect executes - designs data model, API, authorization, workflows]

Agent Runtime: "Phase B complete. Outputs:
  - Data model: Customer entity with relationships
  - API: 7 endpoints defined
  - Authorization: ABAC policies for customer operations
  - Patterns followed: All SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md patterns applied

Do you approve Phase B? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Plan action complete! Ready for build action."
```

### Scenario 2: Iteration on Phase A
```
User: "Run the plan action for order processing workflow"

[Phase A executes]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A complete. Do you approve?"

User: "reject - the personas don't match our actual users"

Agent Runtime: "What feedback do you have? What should be changed?"

User: "Add a persona for Enterprise Account Managers, they're a key user"

Agent Runtime: "Understood. Iterating on Phase A with your feedback..."

[Product Manager updates personas]

Agent Runtime: "Phase A updated. New outputs:
  - 3 personas (added Enterprise Account Manager)
  - Stories updated to reflect enterprise account needs

Do you approve Phase A now? (approve/reject/request changes)"

User: "approve"

[Continues to Phase B...]
```

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [init action](./init.md) - Bootstrap project structure
- **Next:** [build action](./build.md) - Implement the plan (all features)
- **Next:** [feature action](./feature.md) - Implement incrementally (one feature)
- **Alternative:** [validate action](./validate.md) - Validate architecture before building

---

## Notes

- Plan action can be run for the entire project or individual features
- Approval gates are mandatory - cannot skip to Phase B without Phase A approval
- Product Manager seeds the minimal ontology stub in Phase A; Architect completes ontology bindings in Phase B
- If requirements change mid-project, re-run plan action for affected features
- Both agents use templates from `agents/templates/` for consistency
- Architect must reference SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md to ensure pattern compliance
