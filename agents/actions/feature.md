# Action: Feature

## User Intent

Build a single feature as a complete vertical slice (backend + frontend + tests + deployability checks) that can be deployed and tested independently. Ideal for incremental delivery.

## Agent Flow

```
Architect (Implementation Orchestration)
  ↓
(Backend Developer + Frontend Developer + AI Engineer [if AI scope] + Quality Engineer + DevOps)
  ↓ [Parallel Implementation]
[SELF-REVIEW GATE: Each agent validates their work]
  ↓
Code Reviewer + Security
  ↓ [Parallel Reviews]
[Review Gate: resolve critical findings]
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews and approves]
  ↓
[SIGNOFF GATE: required reviewer evidence verified]
  ↓
[CANDIDATE EVIDENCE GATE: pre-closeout evidence + tracker validation]
  ↓
Architect (Knowledge-Graph Reconciliation)
  ↓ [ARCHITECT KG GATE: bind the as-built source into the graph for future runs]
[PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT: status, archive, supersession, tracker sync, story index]
  ↓
Feature Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Mixed (architect-led orchestration kickoff, parallel implementation including deployability checks, parallel code+security reviews, single approval gate, required signoff verification, pre-closeout candidate evidence validation, a post-build architect knowledge-graph reconciliation, and PM closeout including tracker sync; AI Engineer runs when feature includes AI scope)

## Retrieval Contract

Retuned by `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/eval.py`; do not hand-edit without running eval.

```yaml
tier_defaults:
  feature:
    clean:           { start_tier: 1, max_auto_tier: 2 }
    drift-reconcile: { start_tier: 3, max_auto_tier: 4 }
```

- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/lookup.py <feature-id>` is a first-pass scope resolver and retrieval aid, not an authoritative source of truth.
- Raw artifacts win on conflict: `feature-assembly-plan.md`, stories, ADRs, API contracts, schemas, and policy artifacts outrank KG output.
- Navigate instead of eager-loading: open linked raw artifacts only when the current gate, review, or drift repair needs them.

## Context Files

Load in this order when the work is feature-scoped:

1. `agents/ROUTER.md`
2. `agents/agent-map.yaml`
3. `agents/docs/AGENT-USE.md`
4. `agents/actions/feature.md`
5. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/feature-assembly-plan.md` (the Primary Spec — authored in G0 Step 0 of this action; read once it exists, not a precondition)
6. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`
7. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`
8. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
9. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/code-index.yaml`
10. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/coverage-report.yaml`
11. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/**`

## On-Demand Paths

- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/<openapi-spec>.yaml`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/authorization-matrix.md`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/policies/policy.csv`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/*.yaml` beyond what `lookup.py` already returned
- `agents/<role>/references/**` only after a matching `agents/ROUTER.md` row

## Primary Spec

- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/feature-assembly-plan.md` is the canonical execution spec for feature implementation
- It is **authored by this action at G0 (Step 0)** — it is not a `plan` deliverable and not a precondition (per `plan.md`, the assembly plan belongs to `feature.md` Step 0). On a clean first run it does not exist yet and G0 creates it; on a `drift-reconcile` or evidence-only rerun it already exists and G0 reconciles it instead of overwriting.
- When the assembly plan conflicts with raw story text, follow the feature assembly plan and log the reconciliation

## Ownership Contract

- `product-manager` owns feature closeout, trackers, `STATUS.md` final state, archive moves, and the **lifecycle-coupled** `feature-mappings.yaml` path/status updates (e.g. `status → archived-done` and the archive-path rewrite that follow the folder move)
- `architect` owns `feature-assembly-plan.md`, ADRs, canonical shared semantics, API contracts, schemas, authorization artifacts, and the **semantic knowledge-graph** — `code-index.yaml` bindings and `canonical-nodes.yaml`. The architect reconciles these against the as-built source at gate `G7` (after signoff, before PM closeout), so the graph the *next* feature's architect reads at G0 reflects what actually shipped
- Implementation roles edit their runtime layers and shared feature evidence surfaces only
- Shared-semantics and knowledge-graph **binding** changes route back to `architect`; other roles flag drift instead of redefining it. The PM closeout **verifies** the graph is green (does not author new bindings); a detected binding delta vs. the architect's `G7` reconciliation routes back to the architect rather than being patched in closeout

## Forbidden

- Hand-enumerating schemas, ADRs, or contract files when `lookup.py` output is available
- Treating lookup/KG mappings as authoritative over raw artifacts
- Editing code without prior `hint.py <path>`
- Editing a bound method body without prior `lookup.py --symbol <name>` (or `hint.py --symbol <name>`)
- Editing shared semantics without prior `blast.py <node-id>`
- Continuing after a runtime-blocked failure without re-running runtime preflight
- Skipping any gate from `G0` through `G8` (including the `G7` architect knowledge-graph reconciliation)
- Authoring new `code-index.yaml` bindings or `canonical-nodes.yaml` entries during PM closeout instead of at the `G7` architect gate (closeout verifies the graph; it does not shape it)
- Running the path-sensitive `coverage-report.yaml` regeneration *before* the closeout archive move (it re-stales immediately; regenerate after the move)
- Declaring done without the explicit Product Manager role switch at `G8`
- Widening scope outside the current feature
- Climbing past `max_auto_tier` without recording `workstate.py escalate`

## Gate Contract

- `G0 ARCHITECT ASSEMBLY PLAN VALIDATION` — Step 0 and Step 0.5
- `G1 RUNTIME PREFLIGHT` — Runtime Preflight & Failure Triage
- `G2 SELF-REVIEW` — Step 2 Agent Validation
- `G3 CODE + SECURITY REVIEW` — Step 3 Parallel Reviews
- `G4 APPROVAL` — Step 4 Feature Review
- `G5 SIGNOFF` — Step 5 Required reviewer evidence verification
- `G6 CANDIDATE EVIDENCE VALIDATION` — Step 6 pre-closeout evidence validation and tracker validation
- `G7 ARCHITECT KG RECONCILIATION` — Step 7 architect binds the as-built source into the semantic knowledge-graph (`code-index.yaml`, `canonical-nodes.yaml`) before closeout
- `G8 PM CLOSEOUT` — Step 8 Product Manager closeout, supersession, tracker sync, and final validation

## Canonical Evidence Package

Every governed completed-terminal feature run writes its evidence into the canonical package shape defined by the Feature Evidence Contract in `CONSUMER-CONTRACT.md` at:

```text
{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/runs/{RUN_ID}/
```

The feature index root lives separately at `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/features/F####-{slug}/` and carries `latest-run.json` once the run is approved.

The stage validation contract dictates which artifacts must exist at each gate. The full set produced by closeout:

- `README.md` (template: `agents/templates/feature-evidence-readme-template.md`)
- `evidence-manifest.json` (template: `agents/templates/evidence-manifest-template.json`)
- `action-context.md`
- `feature-action-execution.md` (template: `agents/templates/feature-action-execution-template.md`)
- `artifact-trace.md` (template: `agents/templates/artifact-trace-template.md`)
- `gate-decisions.md` (template: `agents/templates/gate-decisions-template.md`)
- `commands.log` (schema: `agents/templates/commands-log-template.md`)
- `lifecycle-gates.log` (schema: `agents/templates/lifecycle-gates-log-template.md`)
- `g0-assembly-plan-validation.md` (Architect output at G0)
- `g1-runtime-preflight.md` (template: `agents/templates/runtime-preflight-template.md`; required only when `runtime_bearing = true`)
- `g2-self-review.md` (template: `agents/templates/self-review-template.md`)
- `test-plan.md` (template: `agents/templates/test-plan-template.md`)
- `test-execution-report.md` (template: `agents/templates/test-execution-report-template.md`)
- `coverage-report.md` (template: `agents/templates/coverage-report-template.md`)
- `deployability-check.md` (template: `agents/templates/deployability-check-template.md`)
- `code-review-report.md` (template: `agents/templates/code-review-report-template.md`)
- `security-review-report.md` (template: `agents/templates/security-review-template.md`; required when `security_sensitive_scope = true` or Security Reviewer is required)
- `signoff-ledger.md` (template: `agents/templates/signoff-ledger-template.md`)
- `kg-reconciliation.md` (Architect output at `G7`; template: `agents/templates/kg-reconciliation-template.md`) — the as-built-vs-graph binding delta, new/affirmed canonical nodes, and the green-validator record
- `pm-closeout.md` (template: `agents/templates/pm-closeout-template.md`)

The feature index root also carries `latest-run.json` once the run is approved.

Run-ID format: `YYYY-MM-DD-XXXXXXXX` — date is local-at-session-start; `XXXXXXXX` is 8-char hex from cryptographic randomness (e.g. `secrets.token_hex(4)`). The run ID is recorded in `action-context.md` and the manifest at G0 and carried unchanged through closeout. Validators must not infer the active run by sorting folders; use the Feature Evidence Contract run-resolution rules.

### Closeout Supersession-And-Publish Sequence

When this action writes a new `latest-run.json` at G8/closeout, perform exactly this order:

1. Invoke `agents/product-manager/scripts/patch-prior-manifest.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --new-run-id {RUN_ID}` to mark every prior approved manifest for this feature as `superseded`. The helper is idempotent and exits 0 with no priors.
2. Only after step 1 succeeds, write `latest-run.json` pointing at the new run.

If step 1 fails, do not proceed to step 2. Surface the failure with the partial-closeout recovery guidance in `agents/docs/MANUAL-ORCHESTRATION-RUNBOOK.md`. Validator catch-rule `two_approved_runs_without_supersession_fails` enforces the invariant as defense in depth.

### Per-Gate Evidence Validation

Run `validate-feature-evidence.py` after producing each gate's artifacts so missing evidence is caught at the gate, not at closeout. Use the in-progress `--run-id` mode for gates before `latest-run.json` exists.

| Gate | Command | Stage |
|------|---------|-------|
| G0   | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G0` | `G0` |
| G1   | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G1` | `G1` |
| G2   | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G2` | `G2` |
| G3   | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G3` | `G3` |
| G4 | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G4` | `G4` approval decision and mitigation token validation |
| G5 | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G5` | `G5` |
| G6 | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G6` | `G6` candidate validation; runs **before** tracker sync |
| G7 | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols --regenerate-decisions --check-decisions && python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` | Architect KG reconciliation — semantic-graph (`code-index.yaml` / `canonical-nodes.yaml`) bound against the as-built source; symbol/unbound and decisions regeneration + drift checks exit 0. Binds **code** paths only (stable across the closeout archive move) |
| G8 | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --stage closeout` | After supersession-and-publish completes — `latest-run.json`, `kg-reconciliation.md`, and `pm-closeout.md` must exist; tracker results must be in `lifecycle-gates.log` |

Stage-validation failures must be repaired before advancing the gate. Do not skip stage validation even when the missing artifact "will land later" — the Feature Evidence Contract stage matrix declares exactly which artifacts must exist by stage.

Tracker validation at `G6` and `G8` must be scoped to the current feature/run
with `--product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}`.
Repo-wide feature-evidence validation is a separate health/audit action and is
not a default feature gate.

## Stop Conditions

- Runtime preflight fails and cannot be restored
- A critical code or security finding remains after one review cycle
- Required signoff is missing reviewer, date, or evidence
- A non-architect attempts to edit architect-owned canonical semantics
- Scope drifts outside the declared feature boundary
- `validate.py` or `validate.py --check-drift` fails and cannot be repaired within scope
- `INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT`: `lookup.py` returns empty scope for a declared in-scope node, or only ambiguous / low-confidence (`inferred`, `confidence < 0.5`) matches on a node about to be edited, or the workflow needs to climb past `max_auto_tier`; halt the current gate, invoke `workstate.py escalate <reason> --nodes ... --opened-raw ...`, open the raw artifacts, and do not proceed with weak matches

## Exit Validation

Run in this order. Steps are grouped by gate; the `G7` architect group binds **code** paths (stable across the archive move) and the `G8` group runs the path-sensitive regeneration **after** the closeout archive move.

1. Applicable backend / frontend / AI / QE runtime commands for changed surfaces, with evidence paths recorded under `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/**`
2. **[G6]** `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G6` (candidate validation before tracker sync)
3. **[G6]** `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}` (scoped tracker validation; calls feature-evidence at `--stage G6`; appends tracker results to `lifecycle-gates.log`)
4. **[G7]** `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols --regenerate-decisions --check-decisions` (architect; after confirming/adding `code-index.yaml` bindings + `canonical-nodes.yaml` entries for the as-built source)
5. **[G7]** Record the successful symbol/unbound + decisions regeneration/check command in `commands.log`, `lifecycle-gates.log`, and `kg-reconciliation.md`
6. **[G7]** `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` (the architect's semantic graph must be green before closeout)
7. **[G8]** After supersession-and-publish completes (`patch-prior-manifest.py` then `latest-run.json`) and the feature folder has been moved to `archive/`: `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --stage closeout`
8. **[G8]** `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/` when story files moved/changed
9. **[G8]** `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report` — run **after** the archive move, because it binds the (now-moved) feature-doc paths; running it earlier re-stales on the move
10. **[G8]** `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` (final confirmation the post-move graph is green)
11. `python3 agents/scripts/validate_templates.py`

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates feature flow and gates; keep it stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/lint/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Review and approval decisions must cite evidence produced by those application runtime executions.

## Runtime Preflight & Failure Triage (Mandatory)

Before any compile/test/lint/security scan command:

1. Verify required application runtime containers/jobs are running and healthy.
   - Example (containerized stacks): `docker compose ps` + health checks/log probe.
   - Non-containerized stacks: run the equivalent runtime readiness command(s).
2. Record preflight evidence path (command + timestamp + result) in the feature execution log.
3. If runtime is unavailable, restore runtime first, then re-run preflight before executing feature validation commands.

If a validation command fails with runtime symptoms (for example connection refused, DNS/network resolution errors, dependency service unavailable, missing container):

1. **Stop code edits immediately.**
2. Classify failure as `runtime-blocked` in feature execution notes.
3. Re-run runtime preflight and restore runtime health.
4. Re-run the same failed validation command **without code changes**.
5. Only treat it as a code defect if failure persists after runtime is healthy.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Architect-Led Feature Assembly Planning

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Architect agent** by reading `agents/architect/SKILL.md`
2. **Read context:**
   - Feature stories in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` scope and constraints
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/` contracts for this feature
3. **Produce feature assembly plan:**
   - Required backend/frontend/AI changes for this feature only
   - Integration checkpoints and dependency order
   - Test and release checklist for the vertical slice
   - **Knowledge-Graph Binding Plan** — the *intended* semantic-graph delta: which capabilities/canonical nodes this feature is expected to add or extend, and the anticipated `code-index.yaml` glob(s). This is a prediction, not a contract; it is the baseline the `G7` reconciliation diffs the as-built source against. "No new nodes; reuses existing semantics" is a valid declaration.
4. **Output artifacts:**
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/feature-assembly-plan.md` (canonical per-feature execution plan; use `agents/templates/feature-assembly-plan-template.md`)
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/feature-assembly-plan.md` to reference the feature-local plan from the umbrella cross-feature sequencing view
5. **Initialize signoff requirements in feature status:**
   - Update `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md` section `Required Signoff Roles`
   - Mark baseline required roles as `Yes`: `Quality Engineer`, `Code Reviewer`
   - Add risk-based required roles (`Security Reviewer`, `DevOps`, `Architect`) when scope warrants

**Completion Criteria for Step 0:**
- [ ] Feature assembly plan exists
- [ ] Feature scope and handoffs are explicit
- [ ] Integration/test checkpoints defined
- [ ] Required signoff role matrix initialized in feature `STATUS.md`

---

### Step 0.5: Assembly Plan Validation

**Execution Instructions:**

Validate the feature assembly plan before parallel implementation:

- [ ] Scope split matches feature story requirements
- [ ] Dependencies between agents are identified
- [ ] Integration checkpoints are feasible
- [ ] No missing or conflicting artifact ownership

Validator:
- Code Reviewer or a second Architect review (lightweight checklist is sufficient)

---

### Step 1: Parallel Feature Implementation

**Execution Instructions:**

Execute these agents **in parallel** for the specific feature. Run AI Engineer when the feature touches `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/neuron/`, LLM workflows, prompts, or MCP.
All stack-specific execution (compile/tests/scans) must run in application runtime containers produced for this project.

Mandatory preflight before implementation validation runs:
- [ ] Runtime preflight executed and recorded per `Runtime Preflight & Failure Triage (Mandatory)`

**AI Scope Checklist — include AI Engineer if ANY apply:**
- [ ] Story mentions LLM, AI, or machine learning behavior
- [ ] Story requires MCP server/tool/resource work
- [ ] Story involves prompts, agent behavior, or tool orchestration
- [ ] Story changes files under `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/neuron/`
- [ ] Story requires model selection, cost controls, or guardrails

- [ ] Feature code compiles/builds successfully in application runtime containers
- [ ] Runtime preflight evidence recorded before validation command execution
- [ ] No critical errors

---

### Step 2: SELF-REVIEW GATE (Agent Validation)

**Execution Instructions:**

Each agent validates their feature work:

Before self-review checks:
- [ ] Re-run runtime preflight and confirm validation environment is healthy
- [ ] If runtime failures are detected, mark `runtime-blocked`, fix runtime, and re-run unchanged validation commands before editing code

1. **Backend Developer self-review:**

### Step 3: Execute Reviews (Parallel)

**Execution Instructions:**

Run these review agents in parallel:

#### 3a. Code Reviewer

1. **Activate Code Reviewer agent** by reading `agents/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`

2. **Read context:**
   - Feature code produced in Step 1
   - Application runtime validation outputs (test, lint, SAST, dependency scan reports)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (feature requirements)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - Feature user stories with acceptance criteria

3. **Execute code review (feature-focused):**
   - Review feature code structure
   - Check SOLID principles in feature code
   - Validate clean architecture boundaries
   - Review feature test coverage and quality
   - Identify code smells in feature
   - Validate feature acceptance criteria met
   - Check SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md compliance
   - Assess vertical slice completeness

4. **Produce feature code review report:**
   ```markdown
   # Feature Code Review Report

   Feature: [Feature Name]

   ## Summary
   - Assessment: [APPROVED / APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS / REJECTED]
   - Files reviewed: [count]
   - Issues found: [count by severity]

   ## Vertical Slice Completeness
   - [ ] Backend complete (API endpoints functional)
   - [ ] Frontend complete (screens functional)
   - [ ] AI layer complete (if AI scope)
   - [ ] Tests complete (unit, integration, E2E)
   - [ ] Can be deployed independently

   ## Findings
   - Critical: [list]
   - High: [list]
   - Medium: [list]
   - Low: [list]

   ## Pattern Compliance
   - [ ] Clean architecture respected
   - [ ] SOLID principles followed
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md applied
   - [ ] Test coverage ≥80% for feature logic

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] All feature ACs met
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] Error scenarios covered

   ## Recommendation
   [APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / REJECT]
   ```

**Code Review Outputs:**
- Feature code review report
- Approval or rejection

#### 3b. Security

1. **Activate Security agent** by reading `agents/security/SKILL.md`

2. **Read context:**
   - Feature code produced in Step 1
   - Application runtime validation outputs (test, lint, SAST, dependency scan reports)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (feature requirements)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - Feature user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Existing `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/` artifacts (if present)
   - QE's `security_scans{}` manifest block and raw outputs under `{RUN_ID}/artifacts/security/`

3. **Execute security review (feature-focused):**
   - Check OWASP Top 10 risks relevant to this feature
   - Verify authorization coverage for feature endpoints/actions
   - Validate input/output validation and error leakage controls
   - Check secrets/config handling (no hardcoded secrets)
   - Validate audit logging coverage for mutations
   - **You are Accountable for the scan verdict:** confirm `security_scans{}` covers all four classes (`dependency`, `secrets`, `sast`, `dast`), each either run with a resolvable artifact or carrying a complete waiver. A missing or unbacked class is a finding — do not `PASS` over it. Read the `artifacts/security/` outputs and apply exploitability/severity judgment the tools cannot; re-run any scanner yourself for deeper analysis when warranted.

4. **Produce feature security review report:**
   ```markdown
   # Feature Security Review Report

   Feature: [Feature Name]

   ## Summary
   - Assessment: [PASS / PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS / FAIL]
   - Findings: [count by severity]

   ## Findings
   - Critical: [list]
   - High: [list]
   - Medium: [list]
   - Low: [list]

   ## Control Checks
   - [ ] Authorization coverage complete
   - [ ] Input validation enforced
   - [ ] No secrets in code
   - [ ] Auditability requirements met

   ## Recommendation
   [APPROVE / FIX CRITICAL / FIX HIGH / REJECT]
   ```

**Security Review Outputs:**
- Feature security review report
- Vulnerability findings and remediation guidance

### Step 4: APPROVAL GATE (Feature Review)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Present combined review results to user:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Feature Reviews Complete
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Feature: [Feature Name]
   Code Reviewer Status: [APPROVED / APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS / REJECTED]

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Review Details:
   [Link to feature code review report]
   [Link to feature security review report]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Feature Approval Checklist:
   - [ ] Feature is a complete vertical slice
   - [ ] Backend implementation complete
   - [ ] Frontend implementation complete
   - [ ] AI implementation complete (if AI scope)
   - [ ] Tests cover feature completely with evidence from application runtime containers
   - [ ] No critical issues (approval blocked if any remain)
   - [ ] High-severity issues fixed OR approved with mitigation justification
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md followed
   - [ ] All feature acceptance criteria met
   - [ ] Feature can be deployed independently
   ```

3. **Enforce approval gate based on combined findings severity:**
   ```
   total_critical = code_critical + security_critical
   total_high = code_high + security_high

   IF total_critical > 0:
     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     OPTIONS: ["fix critical", "reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF total_high > 0:
     STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
     OPTIONS: ["fix issues", "approve with justification", "reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true (requires justification)

   ELSE:
     STATUS: ✓ ACCEPTABLE
     OPTIONS: ["approve", "fix issues", "reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true
   ```

4. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "fix critical":**
     - Identify critical issues to fix
     - Agents fix issues
     - Return to Step 3 (re-run code and security reviews)

   - **If "fix issues":**
     - Identify selected issues to fix
     - Agents fix issues
     - Return to Step 3 (re-run code and security reviews)

   - **If "approve with justification":**
     - Capture explicit mitigation justification for remaining high issues
     - Log decision with mitigation plan
     - Proceed to Step 5 (Signoff Gate)

   - **If "approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 5 (Signoff Gate)

   - **If "reject":**
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to Step 0 (re-plan and re-implement feature)

   - **If user input is not in current state's allowed options:**
     - Do not transition
     - Re-present current state and allowed options

5. After an approving decision is recorded in `gate-decisions.md`, run scoped G4 validation before signoff:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G4`

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Code + security critical issues = 0 before approval is enabled
- [ ] High issues fixed or approved with explicit mitigation justification
- [ ] Feature is complete vertical slice
- [ ] User decision recorded with rationale when required
- [ ] `validate-feature-evidence.py --stage G4` exits 0 before signoff

---

### Step 5: SIGNOFF GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Before setting feature status to `Done` or moving to archive, verify role signoffs:

1. Read `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md`:
   - `Required Signoff Roles` matrix (planning baseline)
   - `Story Signoff Provenance` (execution evidence)
2. For every role marked `Required = Yes`, confirm ledger has:
   - a row per story in scope
   - `PASS` (or `APPROVED`) verdict
   - reviewer identity
   - review date
   - concrete evidence path(s) to solution artifacts under `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/**`
3. If any required role is missing or non-pass:
   - Block feature closeout
   - Route back to the owning reviewer role
4. Only after all required signoffs pass:
   - Proceed to candidate evidence validation (Step 6 / gate `G6`)

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Every required signoff role has a passing ledger entry
- [ ] Every required signoff includes reviewer/date/evidence
- [ ] No `Done`/`Archived` transition occurs without passing required signoffs

---

### Step 6: CANDIDATE EVIDENCE VALIDATION (Mandatory)

**Gate `G6`.** Runs after signoff (`G5`), before the architect KG reconciliation (`G7`) and PM closeout (`G8`). This is the pre-closeout candidate checkpoint: confirm the run's evidence is complete and internally consistent **before** any closeout mutation (archive move, supersession, `latest-run.json`). No PM closeout actions occur here.

**Execution Instructions:**

1. Confirm all `G0`–`G5` evidence artifacts exist and their verdicts are passing.
2. Write `feature-action-execution.md` with a gate-by-gate timeline of the run.
3. Confirm the manifest is a pre-closeout candidate: `status: in-progress`, `gate_results` through `signoff` present, and `pm_closeout` / `tracker_sync` absent or `required: false` (no `latest-run.json` yet).
4. Run candidate stage validation:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID} --stage G6`
5. Run tracker validation (it internally calls feature-evidence at `--stage G6`) and append the result to `lifecycle-gates.log`:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}`

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] All `G0`–`G5` evidence present with passing verdicts
- [ ] `feature-action-execution.md` complete with a gate-by-gate timeline
- [ ] Manifest is a valid pre-closeout candidate (no closeout artifacts yet)
- [ ] `validate-feature-evidence.py --stage G6` exits 0
- [ ] Scoped `validate-trackers.py --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}` passes and its result is recorded in `lifecycle-gates.log`

---

### Step 7: ARCHITECT KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH RECONCILIATION (Mandatory)

**Gate `G7`.** Runs after signoff (`G5`) and candidate validation (`G6`), before PM closeout (`G8`). The graph is now reconciled against the **as-built** source — what actually shipped, not what G0 predicted — so the knowledge-graph the *next* feature's architect reads at G0 is correct. This gate owns the **semantic** graph only; it binds **code** paths (`experience/...`, `api/...`, etc.) that do **not** move during the closeout archive step, so it is safe to run before the move.

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Architect agent** by reading `agents/architect/SKILL.md`.
2. Diff the as-built source against the graph's G0 declaration (the `feature-assembly-plan.md` "Knowledge-Graph Binding Plan", if present) to find the binding delta — capabilities, modules, or shared semantics that emerged during implementation.
3. For every new source surface that represents a capability or shared semantic, add or update its binding in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/code-index.yaml`. Bind by **directory glob** where a cohesive folder represents one capability (e.g. `experience/src/features/forms/**`), not file-by-file. Existing globs that already cover new files need no change — confirm coverage rather than duplicating.
4. If the feature introduced new canonical nodes or rationale (`WHY`) entries, add them to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`. If it introduced none, state that explicitly.
5. Regenerate and validate all code-path-derived generated layers: `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols --regenerate-decisions --check-decisions`. This refreshes `symbol-index.yaml`, `unbound-but-referenced.yaml`, and `decisions-index.yaml`; it is mandatory even when the authored KG files appear unchanged. (Editing a bound method body without first consulting `lookup.py --symbol` / `hint.py --symbol` is forbidden — the symbol layer keeps edits narrow.)
6. Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` and resolve any errors. Do **not** run `--write-coverage-report` here — coverage binds feature-doc paths that the PM closeout archive move will relocate; regenerating it now re-stales it on the move. Coverage regeneration is a `G8` step, after the move.
7. Record the outcome in `kg-reconciliation.md` (template: `agents/templates/kg-reconciliation-template.md`): the binding delta applied, new/affirmed canonical nodes, and the green generated-layer + drift validator results.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Architect agent activated for the reconciliation
- [ ] `code-index.yaml` bindings exist for every new capability/shared-semantic source surface (glob-based; existing coverage confirmed, not duplicated)
- [ ] New canonical nodes/rationale recorded in `canonical-nodes.yaml`, or "none introduced" stated explicitly
- [ ] `validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols --regenerate-decisions --check-decisions` exits 0
- [ ] `validate.py --check-drift` exits 0
- [ ] `coverage-report.yaml` was **not** regenerated at this gate (deferred to `G8`, post-archive-move)
- [ ] `kg-reconciliation.md` written

---

### Step 8: PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Product Manager agent** by reading `agents/product-manager/SKILL.md`
2. Reconcile feature closure artifacts:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md` (final status, deferred follow-ups, mitigation notes)
   - `STATUS.md` required signoff matrix + story signoff provenance entries
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` (status/path transitions, including archive moves)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` (Now/Next/Later/Completed placement)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (feature/story status labels and links, if changed)
3. For completed features (`Overall Status: Done`), move the feature folder to archive when appropriate:
   - From `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/`
   - To `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/archive/F{NNNN}-{slug}/`
   - Then update impacted feature-local links and registry paths
4. If ontology-backed planning exists for the feature, update feature/path/status references in:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
5. Record any orphaned stories, deferred follow-ups, or explicit mitigation carry-overs before final validation
6. **Knowledge-graph: verify, then regenerate the path-sensitive layer (do not author bindings here):**
   - The **semantic** graph (`code-index.yaml` bindings, `canonical-nodes.yaml`) was reconciled by the Architect at `G7` and `kg-reconciliation.md` records it. Closeout **verifies** it is green — it does not add or edit bindings. If a binding gap is discovered now (a capability surface the `G7` reconciliation missed), route back to the Architect for a `G7` delta pass rather than editing the graph in closeout.
   - After the archive folder move (step 3) and the `feature-mappings.yaml` status/path update (step 4), regenerate the **path-sensitive** coverage layer, which binds the now-relocated feature-doc paths: `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report`.
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` to confirm the post-move graph is green.
7. **Publish the approved run** in the supersession-and-publish order (see "Closeout Supersession-And-Publish Sequence"): run `patch-prior-manifest.py` to mark prior approved manifests `superseded`, then write `latest-run.json` pointing at this run, then finalize the manifest to `status: approved`.
8. **Tracker sync:** regenerate the story rollup when story files moved/changed (`python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`), then run final closeout validation (`python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --stage closeout`) and scoped tracker validation (`python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}`). Treat any tracker drift as blocking and re-run after repair.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Product Manager closeout executed after signoff and `G7` architect KG reconciliation passed
- [ ] Final feature status and archive decision recorded
- [ ] Deferred follow-ups and mitigation notes captured
- [ ] `feature-mappings.yaml` status/path updated for the archive move (lifecycle-coupled, PM-owned)
- [ ] `kg-reconciliation.md` present and its semantic-graph checks green (verified, not re-authored, by closeout)
- [ ] `coverage-report.yaml` regenerated **after** the archive move
- [ ] `validate.py --check-drift` exits 0 on the post-move graph
- [ ] Prior approved manifests patched to `superseded` and `latest-run.json` written (supersession-and-publish order)
- [ ] REGISTRY/ROADMAP/BLUEPRINT synchronized; STORY-INDEX regenerated if story files changed
- [ ] Final `validate-feature-evidence.py --stage closeout` and scoped `validate-trackers.py --feature {FEATURE_ID} --run-id {RUN_ID}` pass (tracker results recorded in `lifecycle-gates.log`)

## Vertical Slicing Best Practices

### What Makes a Good Vertical Slice?

1. **Complete:** Includes backend, frontend, tests, deployability checks, and AI layer changes when AI scope exists
2. **Deployable:** Can be released independently
3. **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria
4. **Small:** Can be completed in 2-5 days
5. **Valuable:** Delivers user value on its own

### Good Feature Examples
- ✅ "View customer list with pagination"
- ✅ "Create new order with required fields"
- ✅ "Search accounts by name"
- ✅ "View activity timeline for an account"

### Bad Feature Examples (Too Large - Break Down!)
- ❌ "Build entire customer management module"
- ❌ "Implement full order processing workflow"
- ❌ "Complete onboarding process"

### Not Vertical Slices
- ❌ "Create all database tables" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Build all backend APIs" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Create all forms" (not vertical)

---

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Customer List Feature
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer list with pagination"

Agent Runtime: [Reads feature.md]
Agent Runtime: "I'll implement the customer list feature as a vertical slice..."

[Step 0: Feature assembly planning]
  Architect:
    - Feature scope and dependencies mapped
    - Ownership assigned for backend/frontend/AI/test tasks

[Step 1: Parallel implementation]
  Backend Developer:
    - GET /api/customers endpoint with pagination
    - CustomerService.ListAsync method
    - Unit tests for service
    - Integration tests for endpoint

  Frontend Developer:
    - CustomerList component
    - TanStack Query hook for fetching customers
    - Pagination controls
    - Component tests

  Quality Engineer:
    - E2E test: View customer list
    - E2E test: Navigate pages
    - Test plan for customer list

  DevOps:
    - Container smoke test for feature runtime
    - Validate env var and compose changes
    - Record deployability evidence

[Step 2: Self-review - all pass]

[Step 3: Parallel reviews]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews complete. Results:
  - Vertical slice: Complete
  - Issues: 2 medium (naming conventions)
  - Security findings: 0 critical, 0 high, 1 low
  - Test coverage: 85%
  - Acceptance criteria: All met
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS"

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review complete. Do you approve? (approve/fix issues/reject)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Required signoffs are complete, PM closeout and tracker sync passed. Customer list with pagination is ready to merge."
```

### Scenario 2: Iteration After Rejection
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer search"

[Steps 0.5-3 execute]

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review results:
  - Issues: 1 critical (missing authorization check)
  - Recommendation: FIX CRITICAL"

User: "fix critical"

Agent Runtime: "Fixing authorization check..."
[Backend Developer adds authorization]

[Step 3: Re-review]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews updated. Results:
  - Authorization: Fixed
  - Security status: PASS
  - Recommendation: APPROVED"

[Step 4: Re-approval]
Agent Runtime: "Do you approve now?"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Required signoffs are complete, PM closeout and tracker sync passed. Feature ready."
```

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [plan action](./plan.md) - Plan the feature
- **Alternative:** [build action](./build.md) - Build multiple features together
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Document the feature
- **After:** [blog action](./blog.md) - Blog about the feature

---

## Notes

- Feature action is the **recommended way** to build incrementally
- Each feature should be merged to main after approval
- Features can build on each other (dependencies allowed)
- Prefer small, frequent features over large batches
- Feature action ensures true vertical slicing discipline
- Security review is part of the feature action (run `review` action separately for deeper audit scope when needed)
- DevOps deployability check is included; use `build` action for broader infra redesign across multiple features
- Critical findings block approval; high findings require explicit mitigation justification if approved
- Signoff must pass before PM closeout, and PM closeout must finish before final tracker sync
