This prompt encodes the plan action under the base run evidence profile in the Feature Evidence Contract in `CONSUMER-CONTRACT.md` (effective `2026-05-19`). Plan runs BEFORE the feature evidence package exists — it produces planning artifacts in `{FEATURE_PATH}` and a base run evidence package, but no feature evidence package. The feature evidence package itself is created later by `agents/actions/feature.md` for the same `FEATURE_ID`.

REQUIRED INPUTS (you must set):
- `FEATURE_ID={F####}`
- `PHASE={A | B | A+B}` — Phase A is PM requirements; Phase B is Architect architecture; A+B runs both sequentially
- `FEATURE_MODE={new | existing}` — `new` when the ID is reserved in `REGISTRY.md` but `{FEATURE_PATH}` does not exist; `existing` when the folder already contains at least `PRD.md` and a `STATUS.md` skeleton

OPTIONAL INPUTS (defaults apply when omitted):
- `PRODUCT_ROOT=` — default: sister-repo per `agents/docs/AGENT-USE.md` → Session Setup; override only for non-standard layouts

AUTO-RESOLVED (do not set; SESSION_SETUP and the orchestrator compute these):
- `FEATURE_SLUG` — kebab-case slug for `{FEATURE_ID}` from `REGISTRY.md`
- `FEATURE_PATH` — `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/{FEATURE_ID}-{FEATURE_SLUG}`
- `FEATURE_INDEX_ROOT` — `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/features/{FEATURE_ID}-{FEATURE_SLUG}`
- `PLAN_RUN_ID` — `YYYY-MM-DD-{secrets.token_hex(4)}` generated once at session start
- `PLAN_RUN_FOLDER` — `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/runs/{PLAN_RUN_ID}` (NOT under a feature index root — this is the non-feature base run path per §8)

Echo the resolved absolute `{PRODUCT_ROOT}` path on your first turn before any shell command; every command below assumes that resolution.

Generate `{PLAN_RUN_ID}` once at session start using the contract format `YYYY-MM-DD-[a-z0-9]{8}` — date is the local date, suffix from `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(4))"`. Do not use `uuid4`. Do not regenerate after session start.

Create `PLAN_RUN_FOLDER` at `{PLAN_RUN_FOLDER}/` (note: NOT under a feature index root — this is the non-feature base run path per §8). Initialize base run files from templates: `README.md`, `action-context.md`, `artifact-trace.md`, `gate-decisions.md`, an empty `commands.log` (JSONL), and an empty `lifecycle-gates.log`.

Run `agents/actions/plan.md` for `FEATURE_ID` with `PHASE`. Phase A is PM requirements; Phase B is Architect architecture; A+B runs both sequentially. Determine `FEATURE_MODE` upfront: `new` when `FEATURE_ID` is reserved in `REGISTRY.md` Planned (Reserved IDs) but `{FEATURE_PATH}` does not exist; `existing` when `{FEATURE_PATH}` already contains at least `PRD.md` and a `STATUS.md` skeleton.

Compatibility:
- `PHASE=A` + `FEATURE_MODE=new` → plan creates `{FEATURE_PATH}` and scaffolds PRD, personas, stories, and the STATUS skeleton
- `PHASE=A` + `FEATURE_MODE=existing` → plan updates existing planning artifacts; `STATUS.md` story provenance rows are append-only and must not be mutated
- `PHASE=B` + `FEATURE_MODE=new` → REJECT: cannot run architecture before requirements exist; run `PHASE=A` or `PHASE=A+B` instead
- `PHASE=B` + `FEATURE_MODE=existing` → plan updates the architecture artifacts (ADRs, API/schema contracts, data model, BLUEPRINT §4) and ontology bindings
- `PHASE=A+B` + `FEATURE_MODE=new` → plan creates `{FEATURE_PATH}`, then runs Phase A and Phase B sequentially
- `PHASE=A+B` + `FEATURE_MODE=existing` → plan updates planning artifacts then architecture

Start only when `PLAN_RUN_FOLDER` is initialized and `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py` already exits 0.

Load context in this order:
1. `agents/ROUTER.md`
2. `agents/agent-map.yaml`
3. `agents/docs/AGENT-USE.md`
4. `agents/actions/plan.md`
5. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` (confirm `FEATURE_ID` is reserved or new)
6. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md`
7. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md`
8. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`
9. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`
10. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
11. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/code-index.yaml`
12. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/coverage-report.yaml`
13. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/**` when the feature folder exists

Open these on demand only when lookup links them, the current gate needs them, or drift repair requires them: `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/<openapi-spec>.yaml`, `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/authorization-matrix.md`, `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/policies/policy.csv`, and `agents/<role>/references/**` only with a `ROUTER.md` row match.

Don't generate `{PLAN_RUN_ID}` with `uuid4` or any non-contract format. Don't write or consume `current-run.json`. Don't produce role reports (`g0-*`, `test-*`, `code-review-*`, etc.) — those belong to the feature action's evidence package at `agents/actions/feature.md`, not the plan action. Don't create a feature evidence package at `{FEATURE_INDEX_ROOT}/` during plan; that root is created later by `feature.md`. Don't skip the approval or ontology-sync gates. Don't edit `canonical-nodes.yaml` or `solution-ontology.yaml` outside the Architect phase. Don't treat lookup/KG mappings as authoritative over raw artifacts. Don't climb past max_auto_tier without recording a workstate.py escalate event.

Append every shell command to `{PLAN_RUN_FOLDER}/commands.log` with `python3 agents/scripts/append-command-log.py`, passing `--log`, `--product-root`, `--framework-root`, `--cwd`, `--command`, `--exit-code`, and repeatable `--artifact` values as needed. Artifact paths must be durable product-repo paths, usually under the run's `artifacts/` folder; scratch paths such as `/tmp/...` are not durable evidence artifacts.

Keep ownership strict — product-manager owns Phase A: `PRD.md`, persona files, acceptance criteria, story breakdown, and the initial `STATUS.md` skeleton (Required Role Matrix and empty Story Provenance table). architect owns Phase B: ADRs, API/schema updates, data model, BLUEPRINT §4, `canonical-nodes.yaml` updates, `solution-ontology.yaml` updates, and `feature-mappings.yaml` additions. The per-feature `feature-assembly-plan.md` is NOT a plan-action deliverable — it belongs to `agents/actions/feature.md` Step 0. implementation agents do not run during the plan action, and other roles flag drift but do not silently redefine canonical shared semantics.

Follow these gates exactly:
- `G1 CLARIFICATION` — Step 1.5 Requirements Clarification (PM resolves open requirement questions before approval)
- `G2 TRACKER SYNC (A)` — Step 1.75 Mandatory tracker synchronization (REGISTRY.md / ROADMAP.md / BLUEPRINT.md / STORY-INDEX.md) before Phase A approval
- `G3 PHASE A APPROVAL` — Step 2 user reviews requirements; PM records decision in `gate-decisions.md`
- `G4 ONTOLOGY SYNC (B)` — Step 3.5 `feature-mappings.yaml`, `canonical-nodes.yaml`, and `solution-ontology.yaml` aligned with the Phase B architecture; `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` exit 0
- `G5 PHASE B APPROVAL` — Step 4 user reviews architecture; architect records decision in `gate-decisions.md`

Evidence outputs land in two places. In `{PLAN_RUN_FOLDER}`: the six base run files (`README.md`, `action-context.md`, `artifact-trace.md`, `gate-decisions.md`, `commands.log`, `lifecycle-gates.log`) plus an `Evidence Index` in `README.md` that points to the planning artifacts. In `{FEATURE_PATH}`: `PRD.md`, persona files, acceptance-criteria checklist, story files, `STATUS.md` skeleton (Phase A); ADRs, `README.md` (feature ERD + C4), `GETTING-STARTED.md` (Phase B). The per-feature `feature-assembly-plan.md` is produced later by `agents/actions/feature.md` Step 0, not the plan action.

Plan-time dependency evidence audit: identify direct or impacted feature dependencies from the PRD, architecture notes, `feature-mappings.yaml`, and KG lookup output. Record existing approved dependency evidence references or "audit pending" notes in `{PLAN_RUN_FOLDER}/artifact-trace.md` or `gate-decisions.md`. Automated dependency discovery/validator implementation is a later step; do not substitute repo-wide feature-evidence validation for this plan gate.

Stop immediately if PRD approval is refused, if architecture approval is refused, if the ontology sync gate fails and cannot be reconciled, if `kg/validate.py --check-drift` fails after one repair cycle, or if a canonical node edit is attempted outside Architect role.

Close the run by executing these in order, each exit 0:
- `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-stories.py {FEATURE_PATH}`
- `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`
- `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --skip-feature-evidence`
- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report`
- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py`
- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift`
- `python3 agents/scripts/validate_templates.py`

Do NOT call `validate-feature-evidence.py` at plan — there is no feature evidence package yet. Do NOT run `validate-trackers.py --all-feature-evidence` as plan closeout. The first stage validation call (`--stage G0`) happens during the feature action.

Resolve conflicts like this:
- PRD vs architecture conflict → resolve in Phase B before architecture approval; do not silently change PRD
- existing assembly plan vs new architecture → log reconciliation in `gate-decisions.md`; never silently overwrite
- ontology binding conflict → halt; resolve in `canonical-nodes.yaml` first
