# Feature STATUS Template

Tracks completion progress for a feature. Place as `STATUS.md` inside each feature folder. Used to determine when a feature is complete and ready for archival.

Completion has two distinct checkpoints:
- `Implementation Done`: implementers completed scope and tests.
- `Approved for Archive`: required reviewers signed off with evidence.

# F{NNNN} — [Feature Name] — Status

**Overall Status:** [Draft | In Progress | Done | Archived]
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Story Checklist

| Story | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| F{NNNN}-S0001 | [Story title] | [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [x] Done |
| F{NNNN}-S0002 | [Story title] | [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [x] Done |

## Story × Role Progress

Per-story status across the roles that touch a story, updated live as the feature run
progresses (advisory — not yet validator-enforced). Cell states: `⬜` not started ·
`🔄` in progress · `✅` done · `—` not in scope. Review columns (Code Review, Security)
resolve to `PASS` / `FAIL` at signoff. The **Overall** column is the story's rolled-up
state and must match its row in the Story Checklist above.

| Story | Backend | Frontend | AI | QA | Code Review | Security | DevOps | Overall |
|-------|---------|----------|----|----|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
| F{NNNN}-S0001 | ⬜ | ⬜ | — | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | — | ⬜ Not Started |
| F{NNNN}-S0002 | ⬜ | ⬜ | — | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | — | ⬜ Not Started |

Update points: G2 implementation flips Backend/Frontend/AI to `🔄`→`✅` per slice, and
QA/DevOps when that story's tests/deployability pass; G3 resolves Code Review / Security
per story; the Overall column rolls up (Done only when every required cell is Done/PASS).
Columns marked `—` follow the manifest scope booleans (AI when the slice has AI/LLM scope,
DevOps when `deployment_config_changed`/`runtime_bearing`, Security when
`security_sensitive_scope`).

## Required Signoff Roles (Set in Planning)

Architect sets this matrix during feature planning. Mark only truly required roles as `Yes`.

| Role | Required | Why Required | Set By | Date |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|------|
| Quality Engineer | Yes | [Acceptance criteria and test coverage validation] | Architect | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Code Reviewer | Yes | [Independent code quality and regression review] | Architect | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Security Reviewer | No | [Set Yes when authn/authz/data-boundary/security-sensitive scope exists] | Architect | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| DevOps | No | [Set Yes when deploy/runtime/env-contract changes are in scope] | Architect | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Architect | No | [Set Yes when architecture-risk exceptions require explicit approval] | Architect | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

## Story Signoff Provenance

Complete this before moving `Overall Status` to `Done`/`Archived`.
Every story in scope must have passing evidence for every role marked `Required = Yes`.
`Evidence` must reference solution artifacts, not `agents/**` guidance files.

| Story | Role | Reviewer | Verdict | Evidence | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| F{NNNN}-S0001 | Quality Engineer | [Name/Agent] | [PASS | FAIL] | [file path(s) or report path(s)] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [optional] |
| F{NNNN}-S0001 | Code Reviewer | [Name/Agent] | [PASS | FAIL] | [file path(s) or report path(s)] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [optional] |
| F{NNNN}-S0001 | Security Reviewer | [Name/Agent] | [PASS | FAIL | N/A] | [file path(s) or report path(s)] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [optional] |
| F{NNNN}-S0002 | Quality Engineer | [Name/Agent] | [PASS | FAIL] | [file path(s) or report path(s)] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [optional] |
| F{NNNN}-S0002 | Code Reviewer | [Name/Agent] | [PASS | FAIL] | [file path(s) or report path(s)] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [optional] |

## Feature Signoff Summary (Optional — fill at closeout)

Rollup of story-level provenance into a feature-level verdict. Useful for quick reference during archive review.

| Role | Stories Reviewed | Verdict | Closeout Reference |
|------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| Quality Engineer | [all / list] | [PASS / PARTIAL] | [evidence path] |
| Code Reviewer | [all / list] | [PASS / PARTIAL] | [evidence path] |
| Security Reviewer | [all / list or N/A] | [PASS / N/A] | [evidence path] |

## Deferred Non-Blocking Follow-ups (Optional)

Use this section only when the feature is still `Done` and deferred items are explicitly non-blocking.

| Follow-up | Why deferred | Tracking link | Owner |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| [Item] | [Rationale] | [Issue/Story/Doc] | [Role/Name] |

## Closeout Summary (Fill at archive time)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Implementation completed | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Closeout review date | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Total stories | [N] |
| Stories completed | [N / N] |
| Test count (unit + integration) | [N] |
| Defects found during review | [N] |
| Defects fixed before closeout | [N] |
| Residual risks | [None / list] |

**Scope delivery:** [N / N acceptance criteria met]

**Phase 2 deferrals (if any):**

| Deferral | Severity | Tracking link |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| [Item] | [Low / Medium / High] | [Feature/Issue] |

## Tracker Sync Checklist

- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` status/path aligned
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` section aligned (`Now/Next/Later/Completed`)
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/STORY-INDEX.md` regenerated
- [ ] `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` feature/story status links aligned
- [ ] Every required signoff role has story-level `PASS` entries with reviewer, date, and evidence

## Archival Criteria

All items above must be checked before moving this feature folder to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/archive/`.

## Feature Evidence Contract Alignment (§16, §6)

For governed completed-terminal features (per §6 eligibility — closeout date on or after `2026-05-19`, or `Evidence Reentry Date` post-contract):

- `Story Signoff Provenance` is append-only. Current signoff state is derived as the latest row per `(story, role)`; later rows override earlier ones (`status_stale_pass_followed_by_fail_fails` enforces this).
- Story column values use the format `F####-S####` (e.g. `F0008-S0001`); freeform legacy formats are only tolerated for pre-contract historical rows in archived features that §6 marks as skipped.
- Passing-row `Evidence` paths must resolve under the canonical feature run folder at `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/runs/{RUN_ID}/...` (`status_evidence_outside_package_fails` fires otherwise).
- Every passing row carries an ISO `Date`, a `Reviewer`, and a `Verdict` from `PASS` / `PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS` / `APPROVED` / `APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS`.
- `WITH RECOMMENDATIONS` rows require a matching PM Acceptance Line in `pm-closeout.md` per §15 PM Acceptance Line Format (`status_recommendation_without_acceptance_fails` enforces this at closeout).
- The `Closeout Summary` table's `Closeout review date` row is the parseable signal §6 uses to classify a feature as pre-contract or post-contract. Missing/malformed values default the feature to post-contract and require canonical evidence.
