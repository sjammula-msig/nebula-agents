# Reference Router

20,700+ lines of reference docs across 11 agent roles. Loading all references
for a role wastes context on material irrelevant to the current task.

**Rule**: Before loading any file from `agents/<role>/references/`, consult
the table below and load only the references matched to your current task.
Load multiple rows when the task spans categories. Skip this router only
when the full reference corpus is explicitly requested.

## How to Use

1. Identify your active agent role.
2. Find the task row(s) that match what you are doing.
3. Load only those reference files.
4. If no row matches, load nothing — the SKILL.md and solution-specific
   artifacts in `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/` are usually sufficient.

These roles have minimal references. Load on demand — no routing needed.

## KG Tools

Task-to-tool routing only. The full CLI reference, mental model, lifecycle
triggers, and failure modes live in `agents/docs/KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md`.

| When | Command |
|------|---------|
| Before searching code | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/hint.py <path>` |
| Before editing shared entities/workflows | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/blast.py <node-or-file>` |
| Starting feature work | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/lookup.py <feature-id>` (see KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md for `--tier`, `--fields`, `--allow-missing`) |
| After ontology changes | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` |
| Long session start / decisions / escalations / post-compaction | `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/workstate.py …` (see KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md for subcommands) |
| Hub / risk / undeclared-edge analysis | `pagerank.py`, `risk.py`, `cochange.py --coverage-gaps` (see KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md) |

## Evidence / Ops

Task-to-tool routing only. The full contract — package shape, gate timeline
of who writes what when, manifest, `commands.log` telemetry, verdicts,
eligibility, and waivers — lives in `agents/docs/AGENT-OPS.md`.

Honor `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/.agentignore` before broad product discovery. Treat
`{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/**` as cold archive: start from
`operations/evidence/README.md`, feature `latest-run.json`, and the selected
run's `evidence-manifest.json`; read raw reports, logs, screenshots, and
`artifacts/**` only when the current audit, validation, or failure-triage task
requires those exact files. Full retrieval semantics live in
`agents/docs/AGENTIGNORE.md`.

| When | Command |
|------|---------|
| Validate evidence mid-run (G0–G5) | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature F#### --run-id <run-id> --stage <Gn>` |
| Final closeout validation | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-feature-evidence.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature F#### --stage closeout` (see AGENT-OPS.md for the stage matrix) |
| Closeout supersession (before writing `latest-run.json`) | `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/patch-prior-manifest.py --product-root {PRODUCT_ROOT} --feature F#### --new-run-id <run-id>` |
| Run lifecycle gates (writes `lifecycle-gates.log`) | `python3 agents/scripts/run-lifecycle-gates.py` |
| New run artifact / report | copy the matching skeleton from `agents/templates/` (see AGENT-OPS.md → Package Anatomy) |
